    "content": "July 10th, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nAfter a night at one of my favorite campsites along Blue Lakes Road, I set off at a leisurely time of 7:30 or so towards the trailhead. The drive was fairly short, putting me at the “trailhead” around 7:45. I was using the forest service topo map as my guide, which didn’t quite lead me to the proper trailhead at Wet Meadow Reservoir, but I figured it was close enough. I parked my truck, and started walking up the muddy road to find where the actual PCT crossed.\nJust ahead of where I parked\nAbout half a mile or so down the road, I found the actual trailhead, which had been mostly destroyed by downed trees, and clearly doesn’t see a ton of love from the Forest Service. This starts off at a short spur trail, which meets the Pacific Crest Trail in a few hundred feet. The mosquitos were quite bad through here, so I put on my head net and tried to get through the area quickly. After joining the PCT, the trail loses a bit of elevation as it goes through a small valley. The soil is volcanic looking, as is most of the surrounding area. I have always enjoyed the area between Carson and Ebbett’s Passes.\nOn the PCT proper\nAfter a somewhat long, yet mellow downhill, the trail begins to head back up towards the crest. The route continues up higher on the side of the ridge, and truly feels like a “crest trail” during this time. I passed a handful of PCT hikers, stopping to talk to a few. I talked to one group of older backpackers that had gone to Raymond Lake the previous night. When I told them I was climbing Raymond Peak, they said that they had made it near the summit, but turned around due to the loose rock. After winding along the trail for a few more miles, I was finally at the junction for Raymond Lake.\nThe PCT living up to its “crest trail” name\nI took the junction trail, and followed it nearly to Raymond Lake. I didn’t have a solid plan in place just yet, I wanted to get close and just feel it out as I went. As I rounded a turn, I looked up at a fairly gradual ridge that formed a ramp to the summit area, I knew right away that this would be my route. I quickly got off of the trail, and started cutting up the ridge.\nHeading towards the peak, off trail\nAs it always goes, being off the trail slowed me down a bit and made things more difficult. I was definitely moving a lot slower, but wasn’t moving slow by any means. I stuck mostly to the top of the ridge where I could find nice solid rocks to walk on, occasionally going left or right to avoid trees. Near the top, I crossed a few smallish snow fields, eventually making a left turn to try and head up the peak from the northeast.\nA bit of lingering snow\nThis plan worked out, and deposited me right in the middle of a few possible summits. I glanced at my watch 10:57AM. A mini objective formed in my mind, finish by 11AM. I scurried over to what I thought was the summit, and made it right as my watch hit 11AM. Unfortunately I didn’t see a register or benchmark, and quickly realized I was not at the correct spot. I looked around me, and saw that the true summit was about a hundred feet to the west. I walked over there, and was relieved to find a register. After nearly 10 years, I was finally done with the Ogul list.\nPanorama from the spot I originally thought to be the summit\nI signed the register and took some pictures, but decided to get off of the proper summit pretty quickly as it was covered in annoying flies. I found a nice spot to sit down nearby, and spent a good 30-40 minutes eating lunch and basking in my accomplishment. Finishing with Raymond Peak was a good choice, as I could easily see a large amount of other Ogul peaks, ranging pretty far in each direction.\nMy signature in the register\nI went down, starting off going the same direction I had come up. Soon after though, I decided to hop over one drainage to the west, so that I could make a stop at Raymond Lake. This drainage was quite easy to get down, and I was at Raymond lake in what felt like a few minutes. There I stopped on the south shore, and took a brief dip in the lake. It was still pretty hot, so the lake was a welcome change. The lake has the typical feel of a natural alpine lake, although the volcanic soils make the bottom feel a bit muddy. Still, I’d rate the lake pretty high on the swimability scale.\nMy private beach at Raymond Lake\nAfter getting out and drying off for a few minutes, I put my stuff back on, and walked out back towards the Raymond Lake trail using a well defined use trail on the east side of the lake. I got back onto the trail, and after a few minutes of walking was back on the PCT. The walk back had about 700’ of gain to deal with. That said, the grading was very generous, and it didn’t really feel like uphill or downhill in an extreme sense. More like just walking an easy trail, and a nice one at that. I passed one more thru hiker on the way out, but other than that, had the whole trail to myself.\nAlong the PCT on the return trip\n“No Camfires” sign. I remember noticing this misspelling a few years before while hiking this section of the PCT\nBy 2:30 or so, I was back at the truck and officially done with the Ogul List (a summit doesn’t truly count until you’re back at the car). I went down to Woodfords to grab a celebratory 6 pack (Deschute’s Hazy IPAs), and doubled back to my campsite along Blue Lakes Road for the night.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "July 9th, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nDue to the blisters I had acquired on Anderson Peak and Tinker Knob, I had spent the previous day at home. I was planning to spend this day at home as well, but changed my mind around midday. The plan then morphed into me showing up at the trailhead around 3PM, and enjoying a nice twilight hike. My plan came to fruition, and I arrived at nearly precisely 3PM. The July heatwave was still very much a thing, and I was already sweating by the time I had put on my shoes and saddled up my backpack.\nCrossing highway 50 was probably one of the most difficult parts of the day, I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for an opening in the endless lines of cars coming both ways. Finally, I found a small enough break in traffic to run across the road. I made it across without getting flattened, and was happy to be getting away fom the highway. The first few miles were quite hot, but the forest provided enough shade to make it tolerable. I passed one TRT hiker, but other than that found quite a bit of solitude on the trail. It’s graded nicely, and although it gains some elevation, it never feels too tough.\nThe trailhead on the north side of highway 50\nThe route to Snow Valley doesn’t offer a lot in the way of views for quite some time, this was fine with me, I was content putting my nose to the grindstone and just knocking out some miles. After 4 miles, the trail comes to a junction with a sign labelled “campground” pointing to the west. My best guess is that this leads to Marlette Lake, but I could be wrong about that, and can’t be bothered to do the research. From here, the trail winds around to the west a bit, and starts to make some more significant elevation gain.\nEasy miles closer to the trailhead\nAfter wrapping around to the east, it cuts back to the west, and then back to the north. Around here, the trail starts traversing the side of Snow Valley Peak, and the once viewless hike suddenly opens up to one of the finer views of Tahoe I’ve ever seen. The forest opens up into fields of sage and wildflowers, which were quite fragrant and pleasant on this hot summer day.\nTahoe comes into view\nThe trail nearing the summit\nAfter close to a mile of this, I was more or less directly below the summit by a few hundred feet. I saw on the map that the trail eventually links up with a dirt road that leads to the summit, but I figured there was no point in adding mileage when I was this close. I cut directly up towards the ridge, stopping for shade a few times next to the few sparse trees that are in the area. Shortly after, I was on the ridge proper just a few hundred feet below the summit. In the distance I could see what was either a cell tower, or some dead trees. I was disappointed to find the former at the summit, but the views more than made up for it.\nSummit Panorama\nAn interesting, yet effective register design\nSnow Valley Peak might have the best view of Tahoe of all the peaks on the Ogul list. The only one I can recall with such an expansive view was Ellis Peak, but I think Snow Valley might edge it out. I could also see the Sweetwater Range to the south, Mt Siegel, and countless other area peaks. I found an interesting register, which was made of an old cinder block, with a flat brick over the top to keep water out. I signed the register, and spent a few minutes checking out the communication tower. As much as I despise communications equipment taking away from the natural beauty of a mountain top, I’m also a nerd at heart, and that stuff is cool to look at.\nThe north end of Tahoe glimmering in the setting sun\nI made my wy a tiny bit to the west to a small rock outcropping to eat my sandwich away from all the man made junk. The view here was just as good, and although it wasn’t sunset quite yet, the angle of the setting sun made for some really cool lighting on the lake. After spending some time enjoying the view, I cut back down to the trail, and started the hike out.\nPerfect lighting on the way out\nThe return trip was easy and far more pleasant than the way up. The heat of the day had passed, and it started feeling comparatively a lot cooler than it had earlier. I made good time and only passed 3 hikers on the way out, one of which was a solo lady hiking the TRT, who was tapping her poles together because she thought I was a bear. I made it back to my truck around 7:50, and set off to camp along Blue Lakes road so I could climb my last Ogul Peak the next day.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "July 7th, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nChris and I had a good time the night before hanging out at our campsite. We had finally tracked down the allusive alcoholic Arizona Iced Teas, which we drank to our hearts content. My alarm went off at 5AM, and I was a bit tired from the night’s festivities, but I quickly loaded my truck up and set off for English Mountain, doing my best not to be too loud as Chris was still sleeping. I found some service along Bowman Lake road, and used that opportunity to set a destination in Google Maps. I saw that it was 17 miles down the road, but that Google said it would be over an hour. At this point, I knew I had some rough driving ahead of me. In hindsight, taking highway 89 to Jackson Meadows would have been a much more pleasant drive. The road indeed took over an hour, and required some moderate 4 wheeling at one point, I definitely would not try this road without at least a high clearance vehicle, and not with 2 wheel drive.\nFordyce Lake on the drive in\nI made it to Catfish Lake, which I knew was the closest landmark to where one should start. I then went down a forest service road to the south of the lake, and found a place to park my Truck. I knew there was no “official” route, so I figured I’d just start somewhere and make it up as I went. I made it less than half a mile before abandoning this route, the bushwhacking was simply more than I wanted to do, and I knew there must be a better way. I doubled back to the truck, and ended up driving back north a bit, closer to the lake.\nNot far from the dirt road where I parked\nFrom my second starting point, things were a lot easier, although the intense heat had already began warming the day up. It was around 8:30 by this point, and I wondered if the bushwhack might have been quicker. Regardless, I lumbered along through the forest, mostly dealing with deadfall, and a comparatively light amount of bushwhacking. I was trying to get to the north drainage of the mountain, where it looked like I could follow a creek bed up to the ridge.\nLooking up the drainage\nThis worked fairly well, although I was pretty miserable, and going very slow. A combination of mosquitos, flies, and brushing my legs against a variety of vegetation left me feeling itchy. Paired with the heat, some moderately bad blisters, and perhaps a light hangover from the night before, I wasn’t enjoying this as much as I usually do. Being so close to finishing the Ogul list though, it would take a lot more for me to give up on this day. The route took me up granite shelf after granite shelf, slowly gaining elevation up the steep canyon.\nNearing the top of the canyon\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I made it up to the first bench in the canyon. This bench has a small lake, and offers a bit of a reprieve with some flat walking. The obvious route from there is to follow the same drainage up, which was a lot less steep, and had more vegetation than the route to that point. I continued along, painfully slow, and made it up to near the base of the summit ridge.\nAt the bench\nAt the base of the ridge, I found the going to get easier. The low shrubs gave way to more mature trees, and I even found what appeared to be an old road cut, which I followed for perhaps half a mile to the northwest of the ridge. Around this point, I decided that a ridge walk sounded more pleasant than side hilling, so I scrambled my way up.\nFinally on some fun terrain\nOnce on top of the ridge, my day improved vastly. The breeze cooled me off, the views lifted my spirits, and the class 3 scrambling added an element of fun that seemed to be missing up to that point. I stuck mostly to the ridgetop all the way to the summit. There are a few low points, but overall the route is pretty nice, especially for the Northern Sierra.\nJust below the summit\nNot long later, I was at the top of English Mountain. Up here I found a small communication antenna (labelled as Placer County Search and Rescue’s antenna), and unfortunately, a summit shrouded in flies. This is not the first summit I’ve encountered that was covered in flies, and like the times before, it does make the experience a bit less pleasant. I quickly snapped some pictures, signed the register, and considered going down the ridge to the road I had come in on here. I made my way a bit south of the summit, before deciding that the way I had come in was fine, and turned around to continue that way.\nSummit Panorama\nI retraced my ridge walk a bit, and then cut down to the west side to find some shade and eat my lunch. After eating my lunch and reapplying my sunscreen, I continued back below the ridge, trying to get back to the route I had taken up. I quickly found the old road cut, and took that as far as I could back down the north drainage. The road fizzled out soon, but I knew the way from here. I had a much easier time getting down, opting for a route more to the west than the way I had taken up. I’m not sure which way was better, I think my return trip might have been ever so slightly more efficient.\nWhere I stopped for lunch\nBefore long, I was back at the first bench, and making my way down towards the steeper part of the drainage. On the way down, I once again stuck more to the west, this time following the creek bed as much as possible, which made it somewhat easier. I encountered quite a few biting flies here, they don’t really hurt, but are extremely annoying, adding to the itchy legs theme of the day. Finally, I made it back down to the brush, and this time opted to go a bit south of the way I had come up.\nOne of several small lakes on the mountain\nI went through a few empty lake beds, and then followed their drainages. This got me down with even less bushwhacking, although the final descent down to the road had quite a bit of deadfall. Once back at the road, it was just a short walk back to the truck. On the way out, I went by Jackson Meadow Reservoir, and then enjoyed a glorious 19 miles of sweet, smooth pavement back to highway 89. If you’re doing this peak, I strongly suggest taking the highway 89 route.\nLots of deadfall on the way back\nRoute GPX Track Download",

Thankfully, I had gotten more done before the trip than I had expected when I requested the time a few months prior, so my week wasn’t looking too difficult. To get things kicked off, I talked Chris into joining me for a double peak day, in addition to a section of the PCT we hadn’t done before. We met at the Palisades Tahoe Parking lot at 6:30AM. We left my truck there, and hopped into Chris’ car to head up to Donner Summit. By about 7:15, we were on the PCT headed south. The first mile or so went up some switchbacks and gained a good bit of elevation, passing by Mt Judah and Mt Lincoln, which I recognized from snowboarding at Sugar Bowl when I was a kid.\nLake Mary, near the Donner Summit Trailhead\nSugar Bowl Ski Area\nThe only snow we encountered on the trail\nAfter Mt Lincoln, the PCT stays on the ridge for quite a while, making for a really nice, picturesque trail experience. This is what I always imagine when I hear the words “Pacific Crest Trail”. We soon came across the only snow on the trail we’d have to deal with all day. This particular patch was just steep and exposed enough to warrant going up and around, which we did, and found a light use trail that others had used for the same purpose. After a bit more up and down, our first peak of the day, Anderson Peak, became obvious on the ridgeline ahead of us.\nAnderson Peak comes into view\nWhen we got near the peak, we found a spur trail that we figured must lead to the summit, or at least get us close. We followed it, and soon found out that the spur trail led to the Benson Hut, where we stopped for a few minutes to check out. The hut is in a pretty cool location, although I can imagine the journey to it being a bit treacherous in the winter.\nAfter checking out the hut, we found that the trail continued behind the hut, and up towards the summit. The trail was nicely established in the talus below the peak, although we did eventually abandon it to get around yet another large snow drift. We went above the top of the drift, which was still a good 10’ tall, and then cut straight up to the summit from there.\nThe Benson Hut\nLarge snow drift below the summit of Anderson Peak\nAt the summit, I was pleasantly surprised to find an old aluminum Sierra Club register, the second one of this type I’ve ever seen (the first was on Split Mountain). These were some finely crafted registers, and I was glad to see this one had stood the test of time. We signed the register, and hung out for a bit to eat the first half of our sandwiches and enjoy the view.\nMe and Chris with the register and summit sign\nSummit Panorama\nWe dropped off the south side of the peak, and made our way through some talus a short distance back to the PCT. The route to Anderson was pretty easy going, gaining about 200’ over a mile, all sticking near the top of the ridge. We passed a handful of through hikers and trail runners, this seems to be a popular route for the Soda Springs locals. Soon we were at the base of TInker Knob, which had a nice offshoot trail from the PCT leading straight up to the summit. We quickly made it up, and found a nice rock chair at the top, constructed out of the flat rocks that are all over the summit.\nTinker Knob from the PCT\nChris lounging on the summit of Tinker Knob\nTinker Knob Summit Panorama\nA nice sign below the summit\nI didn’t find a register here, and we spent a shorter time here than we did on top of Anderson Peak before heading back down to the PCT. From there, the PCT wraps around the south side of the peak, and then down to the west side of the ridge, and starts to head down about 1000’ over the next few miles. While I was a bit bummed to be off of the ridge, the beautiful vertical meadow of Mule’s Ears more than made up for the lower elevation. We continued along for a few miles before crossing a creek that feeds the headwaters of the North Fork of the American River. We stopped here to fill up some water, and eat the rest of our lunch. I had been hiking in my Hokas, which I only had ever used for road runs before. I noticed that the shape of the toe box of the shoes was compressing my toes into each other. When I took my shoes off, it appeared that this had already started to form some blisters. It was too late to do anything at this point, but I had a feeling I’d be paying for this mistake in a few days.\nThe lush west side of the Sierra Crest\nAfter getting started again, the sun had warmed up a good bit (did I mention this was one of the hottest days of the year?), and we felt it as we started to regain the elevation to the ridge. Soon enough though, we had crested the ridge once again, and departed the PCT to join the Granite Chief Trail, which leads back to Olympic Valley. The grade here felt a bit steeper, which wasn’t an issue as we were going downhill. At one point we passed an older lady (probably in her 70s) trail running up the trail. Chris and I both agreed that we hope to have that kind of fitness at her age.\nWhere we departed the PCT for the day\nPalisades Tahoe’s Tram\nWe continued down along the trail, which became a bit tough to follow in a few places where the forest gave way to granite slabs, but never had much difficulty. After not too long, the trail joined the Shirley Canyon Trail, which I had been on back in 2016 when I first climbed Granite Chief with my dad. The trail then parallels the creek (Shirley Creek?) for a bit, before finally spitting you out just northwest of the parking lot. We were back at the truck right at 3PM. We then went back to Chris’ car, and found a place to camp near Lake Spaulding, which would set me up for the drive to English Mountain the next morning.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

Thankfully, I had gotten more done before the trip than I had expected when I requested the time a few months prior, so my week wasn’t looking too difficult. To get things kicked off, I talked Chris into joining me for a double peak day, in addition to a section of the PCT we hadn’t done before. We met at the Palisades Tahoe Parking lot at 6:30AM. We left my truck there, and hopped into Chris’ car to head up to Donner Summit. By about 7:15, we were on the PCT headed south. The first mile or so went up some switchbacks and gained a good bit of elevation, passing by Mt Judah and Mt Lincoln, which I recognized from snowboarding at Sugar Bowl when I was a kid.",

Despite being tired, we woke up and cooked breakfast and made coffee so that we could get an early start on the day. After breakfast, we broke everything down and set off down the dirt road back to highway 49. The road out from the trailhead isn’t bad, but has enough ruts and rocks to be a bit slow going. Little did I know that this was just a small sample of what was in store for the day.\nGoogle Maps led us back up 89 through the town of Greagle. I had been just south of Greagle a few months prior to climb Mt Elwell, but had never seen the town itself. The town is quite nice, nestled in a large green valley east of the crest of the Northern Sierra, and seemingly with an economy mostly fueled by golf. We then went through the Plumas-Eureka State Park, which then led to a dirt road. I was a bit confused, as Google Maps showed it taking another hour to go 14 miles. The reason for this became apparent quickly as we slowly made our way up the bumpy, rocky road. The going was quite slow, I think I might have been able to use third gear in my truck one or 2 times on the way. Finally, we arrived at the saddle between Mt Fillmore and Mt Etna, where I planned to start the hike.\nGeorge leading the way up the dirt road, Mt Fillmore in the distance\nI confused the info I had gotten about this peak with that of Haskell, and was expecting to find a nice trail that we could follow. This proved true for perhaps a half mile, as we followed an old forest service road southwest towards the peak. From there, it became apparent as I checked my map that there was no trail leading to the summit - at least not a mapped one. We cut up into the forest towards the south ridge of Fillmore.\nOn the south ridge\nI did my best to avoid too much bushwhacking, as neither my wife nor my dog had signed up for that. We did alright, but there definitely were some small bushes to whack. We soon arrived on the ridge proper, where we picked up a faint use trail that we would use on and off for a bit. The going was pretty easy, and the view soon opened up to the south, where we got a fantastic vantage of the Sierra Buttes.\nThe Sierra Buttes in the distance\nFrom there, we cut towards the west so that we could avoid the steep slopes ahead, and take the more mellow western ridge up to the summit. We crossed some nice forest, complete with some snow patches and small creeks. George took full advantage of both, getting himself wet and rolling in the snow to cool off. There was a good bit of deadfall here, but no bushwhacking to speak of.\nGeorge cooling off in the snow\nAfter a bit longer, we came to a fairly steep slope that would lead us to the west ridge. I asked my wife how she felt about it, and she had no issue going up, so up we went. The going was slow, but steady here. I stopped to pick up yet another Sierra Crest balloon, this one being of the “Happy Birthday” variety. Some kid in Chico probably lost that balloon a decade ago. I’ve lost count of how many of these I’ve found over the years.\nBelow the summit ridge\nOnce through the steepness, we just had one small rock field to cross, and we were on the ridge a few hundred feet below the summit. This section offered minimal resistance, although there was one dense Pine Copse we had to find our way around. Before long, we were at the summit of my 58th Ogul peak. The summit was definitely not the most aesthetically pleasing, its basically just an opening in the bushes. Despite that, the views were pretty nice, and I was glad to be here with my favorite human and animal. One nice bonus was seeing Lassen to the north, a rare sight from the Tahoe area. There was quite a bit of broken glass from what is apparently an old lookout, so I did my best to keep George away from it.\nMt Fillmore’s benchmark\nView looking north from the summit. Mt Lassen can faintly be seen left of center\nWe stopped a bit down from the summit for a break, as there was more shade down there. I had a bit of service, so tried to figure out why Google Maps had led us on such a rough road. I saw that the Quincy-La Porte road was paved to much closer, but Google strangely showed it as closed. I wasn’t 100% convinced, but also didn’t want to find that closure, and have to double back and make the rough ride even longer. I gave up on the idea, and we made our way back down the ridge. This time, we stuck on it for a bit longer, and had an easier time getting back down into the forest. Along the way, there was a large number of recently cut down trees, seemingly for no reason whatsoever. The trees were small, and had not been taken away from where they were cut. We then crossed the forest, and went back to the south ridge.\nA strange place to cut trees down\nWe followed the same route down the south ridge more or less, but did deviate to the east at one point, which made things harder than the way we came up. After a bit more walking, and another brief bushwhack, we were back at the forest service road, and then back to the truck. I was quite relieved to see all 4 tires still inflated, I had developed a tiny bit of anxiety about the drive in giving me a slow leak. At the trailhead, I saw 2 guys on quads, I stopped the second to ask about the Quincy-La Porte Road, but he was not local and had no idea which road he had taken in. We then buckled in for the long bumpy ride out, which was long, but not terrible with good company. We stopped in Greagle for lunch, and made the drive back home with surprisingly light traffic for the 4th of July.\nGeorge leading a low bushwhack\nPlumas-Eureka State Park’s premiere photo op\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "July 3rd, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nI worked on this day, but was able to shift my schedule up an hour, so that we could leave around 4pm that afternoon. The plan was to drive up to the Haskell Peak Trailhead, and quickly bag the peak before sundown. My wife and dog joined me on the drive up, but I would go solo on the hike. The plan worked out about as well as one could hope, and we were on the road by 4:15 or so. We made good time up highways 80 and 89, and were oat the trailhead by about 7:20PM. I grabbed my pretty minimal backpack, and set off within 10 minutes of arriving. I couldn’t quite figure out where the trailhead was, so ended up cutting across some bushes for about a hundred yards before joining up with it.\nOn the trail\nMy plan was to move quickly, as I didn’t want to leave my wife worried in the dark for too long. I immediately began questioning my motive, as it was still quite hot, and I was not at all adjusted to being out of the car yet. Regardless, I pushed on at a good clip, enjoying the very nice and easy to follow trail despite my heavy breathing. The trail crosses through some nice Mule’s Ear fields at some lower elevations, but mostly remains in the trees until shortly before the summit.\nThe trail was pretty nice\nThe grade was pretty moderate, although there were some fairly steep sections that I had to push through to keep my pace up. At around 7600 feet, the trail took a turn to the west, where I encountered some large (for July) snow banks still lingering. The sun was on its way down, but there was still plenty of light at this point.\nSnow around 7600’\nThe trail then turns to the north, passing by a small false summit with some more snow. I knew I was close at this point, so I kept moving. In just a few minutes, I was below the summit block. While passing a hollowed out log, I startled a resident marmot, who went sprinting off in the other direction. Apparently these less frequently traveled northern Sierra peaks don’t have docile marmots like down south. I grabbed my phone, and tried to snap a picture of the marmot, but its pretty difficult to make out in the photos.\nIf you look closely, you can see the marmot running away\nThe trail led me to the base of the talus pile making up the summit, which I walked up quickly. About 35 minutes after starting, I was standing on top of my 57th Ogul peak, right in time for a magnificent sunset. The view of the Sierra Buttes nearby was pretty striking, as were the other various Ogul peaks I could see bathing in the orange glow of sunset. I hung out for a few minutes, and considered drinking the can of beer I had brought up, but decided to drink it back at the truck instead. I didn’t find a register among the giant summit cairn, but didn’t search that hard. After just sufficient time to properly enjoy the view, I set off back down.\nSummit cairn\nThe Sierra Buttes basking in the sunset\nThe return trip was quite quick and easy, I kept moving at a quicker pace than I had gone up at. I was still wearing sunglasses, but there was just enough daylight to not need to take them off, nor require a headlamp. I made my way back to the actual trailhead sign, which was perhaps a hundred feet down the road from where we had parked. There I found my wife and dog waiting for me, and that my wife had gone ahead and set up camp for the night in the back of the truck. We hung out for a few hours and enjoyed each other’s company before going to bed around 10:30.\nHeading back down, the lighting was perfect\nRoute GPX Track Download",

I asked my Dad if he’d be interested in taking the tram at Palisades Tahoe up to access some peaks, and he liked the idea. Him and I climbed Granite Chief via the Granite Chief trail in 2016, so it didn’t really feel like we’d be missing much by taking the ride up. I also further justified it to myself by thinking of how much of a commonplace this kind of thing is in the Alps. We may not have nearly as much infrastructure in the Sierra, but I’m happy to take advantage when I can. I also talked my wife into coming up with us for the day so she could go paddle around the lake near Tahoe City on her SUP.\nWe loaded into the Prius at a leisurely 7:30AM (the tram doesn’t start until 10AM), and made the drive up to the Palisades parking lot, where my wife dropped us off. We got our tickets printed, and loaded onto the tram right at 10. By 10:15, we were up at high camp, which was bustling with activity as that was the day the Broken Arrow trail race was taking place. We made our way up a dirt road, with a steady stream of runners coming down towards us the entire time.\nView from the tram\nUnloading the tram at high camp\nMaking our way up to the ridge\nWe ended up taking a bit of an unplanned detour, going a bit south of the spot where we wanted to be. This forced us to traverse along the west side of the ridge, and over peak 8797. It didn’t add too much time, and we got an extra unnamed peak, so I wasn’t too upset. From there, we crossed by the plaque for the Placer County Emigrant Road. This was apparently a route used by emigrants in the 1800s to come from the Foresthill area to Tahoe.\nLooking towards Granite Chief from Peak 8797\nThe Emigrant Road Plaque\nFrom the Emigrant Road plaque, we were able to get back onto a trail and make much better time. The trail fizzled out a bit as it approached Granite Chief, and became covered in snow on the east side. I went straight up the snow, while my Dad opted to stick to the west side to avoid it. When we reconnoitered at the end of the snow patch, he let me know that he wasn’t feeling up to the ridge walk, and that he’d hang out in a nearby pine copse that provided some nice shelter from the wind. I didn’t feel too bad, as it was a quite lovely place to relax for a few hours. I made a waypoint in my Caltopo app so I could be sure to find him, and set off towards Granite Chief.\nSnow leading up to Granite Chief\nI was on top of Granite Chief in just a few short minutes, where I found 3 other hikers. 2 of them were an older couple, who asked if I could take their picture, and then returned the favor for me. I signed the register, and was soon ready to head for Needle Peak. The older gentleman gave me some info, as he’d done that route a few times before. He mentioned a trail down below the ridge that offered easier going than the ridge proper, but would require gaining the elevation again. Looking at my maps, I think he must be referring to the Tevis Cup Trail. I opted to stay on the ridge, as I find that to just be more fun.\nGranite Chief Summit Panorama\nA rare photo of myself on the peak\nThe ridge down from Granite Chief wasn’t too bad, although there was a decent bit of rock hopping. Once I got below the rocks, the route weaved in and out of some trees, before leading to a small class 3 section that could be avoided to the west, but I chose to just scramble up it. The route then went up another hump in the ridge, where I stopped to transfer some water into the smaller bottle I carry on my shoulder strap. From there, it was just down a bit and then back up towards Needle.\nLooking towards Needle and Lyon Peaks\nMt Mildred to the West\nNeedle Lake starting to thaw\nI made my way towards Needle Peak, and ended up bypassing the steeper section on the west side of the ridge. I found a nice looking route on that side, and took it up to a small shelf just below the summit block. Another short scramble and I was atop my 55th Ogul Peak. I didn’t want to leave my Dad waiting for too long, so I snapped a few pictures, enjoyed the view for a few minutes, and was on my way towards Lyon Peak.\nNeedle Peak Benchmark\nNeedle Peak Summit Panorama\nThe first half of the walk over to Lyon was easy going, just light DG and occasional rocks with some vegetation. After reaching a low point in the ridge however, it turns into somewhat loose talus. The going wasn’t terrible, but it was definitely a bit slower than before. I stuck to the highest point on the ridge as possible through the talus, and made pretty good time up to Lyon Peak. The summit was slightly ambiguous, although there is a small rock cairn to mark it. It almost appears as though the point slightly to the north is higher, but my map confirmed that I was indeed at the summit. I found an empty, very old coffee can, but no register inside of it.\nNearing the summit of Lyon Peak\nLyon Peak Summit Panorama\nFrench Meadows Reservoir and Mt Mildred in the distance\nSnow Mountain and Devil’s Peak, where I had been a few days before\nI hung out for a few minutes to eat some of the lunch I had brought - a small baguette, cheese, salami, and hummus. The lunch was delicious, and on theme with the European style mountain day. I quickly set off after eating, and opted to try to stay below the ridge on the west side for the return trip. This strategy definitely saved time and effort, but my left foot was a bit annoyed with all of the side hilling, especially as I started to get a clump of sand built up inside of my shoe. The wildflowers were quite nice, as was the fact that I wasn’t doing as much calculated rock hopping on this leg. Before too long, I was back below Granite Chief, where I briefly picked up a use trail that helped me avoid most of the rock hopping back to the summit.\nSide Hilling my way back\nNeedle Peak looks much more imposing from below\nOnce back at the summit, I texted my Dad that I was a few minutes away, and jogged down the nice sandy trail to meet up with him. I found his spot easily, and we hung out for a minute or 2 to discuss how the day had gone. We then saddled up, and headed back down the trail. We briefly spoke with a PCT hiker where we crossed the PCT, and then made our way to the proper saddle we were supposed to take back down to High Camp.

    "content": "Full Image Gallery\nJune 19th, 2024 I woke up around 2AM, knowing that this would be a long day that involved at least some bushwhacking, how much exactly was unknown. The drive wasn’t too bad, although I did have to deal with some road work along highway 80 near Yuba Pass. I arrived at the trailhead around 4:45 and quickly got started down the Palisades Creek Trail. There was just enough light to not need my headlamp after a few minutes of letting my eyes adjust, so I walked in the dark.\nDevil’s Peak in the early morning light\nDevil’s Peak’s summit sits on forest service land, but is somewhat landlocked by surrounding private property. There is a corner that one can cross, so I cut cross country after a few miles on the trail to get to that point. A decent bushwhack ensued, but nothing terrible, and I was able to cross right at the corner without any problems. From there, it was just a bit more of a walk with light bushwhacking to get onto the ridge that leads up towards the peak. By about 6:30, I was right below the class 3 scramble up to the summit. I dropped my backpack right at the southwest corner of the summit block, and climbed up it without any issues. The rock was pretty solid, and there were ample hand and foot holds. I topped out on the ridge, and found the benchmark. Looking out at the ridge, it was clear that the proper summit was a bit north on the ridge.\nDevil’s Peak coming into view from the south\nEasy class 3 to the summit ridge\nThe Devil’s Peal benchmark\nI made my way along the ridge without any problems, it was quite a fun little ridge walk, and the lighting of the early morning really added to the ambiance. I didn’t find a register, although I did see some broken glass deep between some rocks. Perhaps that had been a register at some point, although I didn’t see any other signs of one.\nLooking towards the proper summit\nSummit Panorama\nI didn’t spend much time at the top, as I had a long day ahead, so I made my way down and found the spot where I had dropped my backpack. I made good time back down the ridge towards the corner, and crossed there once again. After doing my best to retrace my steps through the brush, I was back on the trail and set off towards Snow Mountain. The trail flattened out a bit compared to what was behind, and got more of a forest canopy over it. The walking was pretty easy and nice, but I knew I’d be back into the brush soon enough.\nComing down the ridge, Snow Mountain in the distance\nI came to about where it seemed to make sense to ditch the trail, and set off into the unknown. At first the going wasn’t too bad, a lot of deadfall, but no real bushwhacking. That changed after about 20 minutes, when I cut a bit further south than I ought to have, and had to deal with some fairly steep and thick bushes. My legs were already pretty cut up at that point, so a few more cuts wasn’t going to do anything. I eventually made it into more forested terrain, and was able to get atop a small ridge leading towards the peak. The going wasn’t too bad from there with some careful routefinding. Before too long, the peak came into view, and I could see that I’d probably have to lose some elevation down into a drainage to avoid private property again.\nTypical conditions in the woods\nLong Valley Creek\nSnow Mountain behind a nice meadow section\nI dropped down into a granite canyon, and again had to deal with some moderate bushwhacking. This route was a bit frustrating as there was a clear path through the rock to the northwest, but I wanted to keep this thing legal, so I took the loss and went down. I crossed a small creek, and started planning my assault on Snow Mountain. There are a few ways you can do it, but I ended up choosing to follow a set of rock benches directly up the northeast face of it. The rock offered a bit of resistance, but was never worse than class 2 with some careful route selection. Near the top, it became snowy, which actually made it relatively easy as the snow was a consistent grade. I crested the top right near a large looking mound, which I went to investigate. By some complete coincidence, the mound ended up being the summit, complete with a USGS benchmark.\nLooking up towards the summit\nI hung out for perhaps 20 minutes, ate lunch, reapplied sunscreen, and soaked in the views. Snow mountain is situated to have some fantastic views of the peaks near Palisades Tahoe, Loon Lake area, as well as those to the north. For the return trip, I decided I’d try to come down a bit more to the north, and skirt the private property a bit more closely. This worked out pretty well, I found a drainage that led more directly down to the low point where I had crossed earlier. From there, I once again did some light bushwhacking back up to the ridge.\nSnow Mountain benchmark\nSummit Panorama\nOnce back on the ridge, I took a more northerly approach, and managed to stay within Mule’s Ear meadows for most of the return trip. I avoided any serious bushwhacking, only having to deal with some ankle high or so stuff. I stopped briefly at Long Valley Creek to fill my water, and made it down to the trail without any drama.\nOne back on the trail, the going was easy. As it often goes with off trail travel, I was just happy to be walking on a trail again. Not having to think about your direction or obstacles makes for a much less fatiguing experience. A few minutes into the trail, I came across the first 2 people I had seen all day. It was 2 men and a Chihuahua, neither had a backpack, and both had towels draped over their necks. They asked me “how far is the river”? Not wanting to sound pessimistic, I just said “really far”. In reality, I think they were somewhere in the range of 4-5 miles from the river, and a few thousand vertical feet. A bit much for not having a pack, and for ~2PM, but they seemed to be aware it was quite far.\nI stopped once again at a small lake east of the trail to filter some more water and eat a bit more food, then continued up the last bit of elevation gain for the day. It was fairly warm at that point, so I slowed down a bit, but it still wasn’t terrible. Once I crested the top at around 6800’, I was basically seeing everything for the first time, as it had been dark when I came through that morning. I passed one more group, and stopped to to talk to a guy doing tree surveying right at Cascade Lakes for a few minutes before making it back to the trailhead.\nRoute Route is approximated, I didn’t record a proper GPS track that day GPX Track Download",

We ended up turning around at around 9k feet due to gale force winds, the kind of wind that literally can blow you off your feet. It was pretty unpleasant, but it made us both want to get back and bag the peak. Things lined up well for another Father’s Day trip, so we camped out Saturday night, and started early Saturday morning up one of the many rocky forest service roads that heads west from the Sweetwater Summit.\nOur campsite\nWe parked at the same spot that we had parked at the year before, an unassuming opening in the brush at about 8k feet. We loaded up with water and lunch, and set off up the dirt road as the sun was starting to rise in earnest. The road is fairly pleasant to walk on, although at times it can be a bit like walking ball bearings. We made good time up to the flat saddle at about 8900'.\nA rustic gate at the saddle, Mount Patterson in the background\nFrom there, the route heads in a more northerly direction, towards the peak. The road slims down to a single track, and a steep one at that. After a bit, it flattened out a bit, and the mahogany gave way to a decent sized stand of Bristlecone Pines. The trail cuts a bit back to the east through the trees, before topping out on top on a ridge that leads to the summit. It looked like people have probably taken dirt bikes up this trail, further evidenced by a plastic grille I found on the trail with the name “KTM” on it.\nA Bristlecone Pine, Patterson again in the background\nThe trail through the trees\nOnce atop the ridge, the route becomes pretty obvious, although the proper summit of South Sister can’t yet be seen. One could drop down and then back up the steep slopes more to the west, but it makes the most sense to follow the curve of the ridge as its pretty gentle, and fairly direct. We lost the trail for a bit, but quickly picked it back up soon. There were deer droppings all along the trail, which makes me think it may be somewhat of a game migration route.\nLooking up the ridge\nInteresting color patterns in the rock\nThe route up the ridge was fairly easy to walk up, and dead simple to navigate. The “trail” was faint at times, but typically pretty easy to follow. I did end up doing some zig zagging up the steeper sections to make it easier on my legs, but we made great time to the summit ridge at around 11k feet. From the summit ridge, we weren’t entirely sure how far the proper summit was. It looked like a few bumps ahead of us could be it, but I had a strong feeling it was a bit further after looking at the map. We made out way along the summit ridge, with a bit of up and down before the proper summit came into view.\nThe summit comes into view\nWe still had a decent distance to cover, perhaps a little less than a half mile, from this point. The going was relatively easy though, and we were nearing the summit in what felt like a few minutes. After one final false summit faking me out, we crested it and got to the base of the summit block. The rocks here were an interesting almost slate like granite that had broken off into thin sheets. The whole area has some of the more interesting and colorful geology I’ve ever seen in the mountains.\nThe summit block\nWe dropped our packs in the rocks, and made the short scramble up to the summit, where we were met with fantastic views in every direction. A surprising amount of the Tahoe area was visible. I could see the Freel - Job’s Peak massif, Highland and Silver Peaks, Mt Rose, Duane Bliss and Genoa Peaks, Pyramid peak, and the list goes on. We found a recently placed register made of 3\" PVC drain pipe; I’ve noticed these PVC registers becoming more common, and I think they seem to make sense. PVC is cheap, light, and pretty durable, so it makes sense to carry up a mountain.\nSummit Panorama\nLobdell Lake in the distance\nPatterson and Wheeler, with a variety of colors in their terrain\nThe wind was a bit annoying, so we came down from the summit to sit in the rocks below for lunch. We spent a good 15-20 minutes hanging out and eating before starting the journey back down. Going down was pretty easy, we managed to keep track of the faint trail pretty much the entire way back to the Bristlecone forest. From there, we lost the trail for a bit as we wandered through the ancient trees and admired them. This was no issue, as we knew the general direction to head, and soon found the trail again. On the way down, we stopped off at a section of the mountain that had been cut out, probably for mining copper ore. We saw some interesting rocks that we assume must have been Malachite. Quite a rugged place to be mining, but people will do anything for money.\nLooking down towards Highway 338\nMy dad coming down the ridge\nAn uprooted, yet completely healthy Bristlecone\nThis tree was probably alive in the BC era\nThe area that we assume was mined for copper\nThe walk down from the mining area was pretty easy. We made it down to the saddle, and back to the road in good time. Shortly after getting back on the road, my dad slipped on the ball bearing surface. It sounded like it hurt, and I briefly worried I’d need to either carry him out or drive my truck up there. He got up though, and it seemed that the worst of it was just a bit of road rash on his leg. We continued down and made it to the truck around 1PM, which gave us plenty of time for the long drive home.\nBack at the saddle\nRoute GPX Track Download",

The minimum mileage you can find it listed at is around 14 miles round trip, but realistically it’s closer to 17+ miles, unless I’m missing some other approach that’s faster than the Tanglefoot Trailhead approach. That said, I decided to continue my trend of getting up at 3AM so I could make it home with some daylight left. I ended up snoozing my alarm, and being a bit slow to get out the door, so I arrived at the TH around 6AM. There was a van parked at the trailhead, and they had set up a tent in one of the only other parking spots. They also had left beer cans in the middle of the dirt road; I try not to hate the recent van life trend, but people like that give vans a really bad name. The road doesn’t dead end for another hundred yards or so, so I just continued down to the dead end and parked there.\nGetting started up the trail\nI quickly saddled up and was on the trail by around 6:15 AM. I quickly made it past the broken Mokelumne Wilderness sign, which currently just reads “Wilderness”, and up to the first unnamed lake. I was hoping to use either that lake, or the lake a few miles ahead as a water source, but the marshy nature of that first lake made me decide to pivot to finding a creek. Thankfully the snow wasn’t fully melted out, even below 7k feet, so that wouldn’t be an issue. Past the first lake, the trail levels out, before beginning downhill into Tanglefoot Canyon. The trail thus far had been pretty well maintained, though there are a surprising number of small metal stakes sticking out of the ground that could lead to some nasty leg injuries if you aren’t paying attention. Clearly some major effort was put into this trail decades ago, but not a whole lot in recent years (this would become even more apparent in a few miles).\nThe broken wilderness sign. Thankfully I knew where I was\nA calm morning at the first lake\nI made good time down the canyon, taking some care down the rocky switchbacks not to roll an ankle this early into the day. Once I got to the bottom, I was happy to see the creek was still quite healthy, and that there was a nice log crossing to get across. From there, the trail meandered through the bottom of the valley a short distance, passing a few Black oaks, which are a rare sight on my peakbagging endeavors. As expected though, the switchbacks started up again shortly, and I switched my mind back into uphill mode. The trail was clearly graded and built with stock in mind, so the 1000’ or so climb up out of the canyon wasn’t too bad.\nCrossing the creek\nA brief moment of nicely maintained trail\nOnce at the top, I came across another lake that I had also held out hope of being able to fill up water at. It was less marshy than the previous one, but still seemed like a filter clogger, so I decided I’d see about the small creek I saw about a quarter mile up the trail. If it was dry, I could double back without too much effort. Above the lake, some downed trees made the trail a bit difficult to find. I made good time to the creek, finding what I thought at the time was a use trail leading to it. I filled up, and took a few minutes to apply sunscreen as I was starting to be in the sun. I then got back on the trail, and did a nice loop through the woods as it turned out the “use trail” to the creek was actually just “the trail”. There was a good amount of downed trees beyond the creek, making the trail a bit difficult to keep track of. To make things more difficult, the trail doesn’t quite match up with where it is on the 2016 USFS topo maps. After another half mile or so though, the terrain starts to open up into more of a subalpine forest, and the navigation gets easier.\nThe second unnamed lake\nMore open terrain above 8k feet\nFrom here, snow patches got more and more frequent, and the navigation was fairly easy. I could see the ridge up Mokelumne Peak, and knew I’d just need to continue a bit further to get to where I needed to cut off trail. I made it a bit shy of where I had mapped out my cut off point, and decided that the band of rock I saw ahead looked better than what might be a bushwhack if I continued. This ended up paying off, as the route I found was quite pleasant for being off trail. I followed a combination of rocks, and rocky soil up and along the south side of point 8628. This eventually led me to the ridge that connects that point to Mokelumne Peak. From atop the ridge, I got a great view of Pyramid Peak, as well as another handful of Desolation Wilderness peaks from a unique vantage. The ridge top was still covered in snow, but the snow was pretty firm and walkable at this hour.\nA nice view of the Crystal Range in the distance\nI made good time along the ridge along the snow, arriving at the end of the snowfield sooner than I had expected. After a shirt walk along the top of the still corniced north ridge, I arrived at the base of the talus field leading to the summit. A short rock hop later, and I was at a false summit just a hundred feet or so from the summit. I made it to the summit at 10:13AM. The view from the top was one of the better ones I’ve seen in the Tahoe area. I think the further west than normal placement, combined with moderate prominence sets this peak up for a fantastic vantage point. I looked around, and counted at least 20 other peaks I could name, most of which I have also climbed. I signed the summit register, which was a pretty well built 4\" PVC canister that looked to be recently put there. The rock shelter on the proper summit was absolutely littered with rodent droppings, so I decided to eat my lunch on a flat rock a few feet to the north. I spent a leisurely 30 minutes or so up there soaking in the views, and savoring my roast beef sandwich.\nNearing the final talus push to the top\nSummit Panorama\nThe view to the east. Da-Ek Dow Go-Et Peak is a bit right of center\nI set back off down around 10:45, making note of the ridge I had taken up. There is another ridge slightly south of the one I had taken up that looks almost identical. That wouldn’t be a deadly mistake, but would likely add a decent bushwhack getting back to the trail if I were to have taken it. Once at the snow, I opted to stick slightly lower where there was still a small amount of shade and the snow was a bit firmer. I made good time along the ridge, but then ended up slightly to the south of my ascent path down closer to the trail, and had to deal with a 10-15 minute bushwhack to get back to the trail. Once back on trail, I stopped again to filter some more water, and reapply my sunscreen.\nNice wildflowers on the way down\nNo adventure is complete without some bushwhacking\nOnce back on trail, it was pretty easy going for the most part back to the second lake. I got off track a few times before the creek crossing due to downed trees, but didn’t have too much difficulty, especially having a reference from coming up that morning. I made it back to the lake pretty quickly, and then made my way down the switchbacks into the canyon. The switchbacks took longer than expected, as they tend to for me on return trips. I always seem to blank out more of the morning than the afternoon. I stopped at the creek to once again filter some water, dunk my sun hoodie, and finish what remained of my food. The climb back up out of the canyon wasn’t terrible, but also wasn’t something I was entirely keen on doing after such a long day. Regardless, I made good time, and was back at the first lake before too long. I ran into the only other person I saw that day there, an older gentleman who was heading to some lake (not sure which one he was talking about), and had no idea what Mokelumne Peak was. Like most places, there’s something for everyone out there.\nA better shot of the second lake. It almost looked clean enough for a swim\nLooking back across Tanglefoot Canyon. I wasn’t looking forward to going back up\nThe rest of the trip down was pretty easy and uneventful. the afternoon had warmed up a bit, but thankfully not too badly. Wetting my sun hoodie had gotten me through the uphill section in the sun, and it was all easy going from there. I successfully avoided the shin destroyer metal stakes, and was back at the truck around 2:45PM.\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

    "content": "June 2nd, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nAs is tradition, I woke up at the ungodly hour of 3AM for this hike. I was left a bit traumatized by the route Chris and I took the summer before up the adjoining Silver Peak, so wanted to get as much time as possible. Highland is a few hundred feet taller, and further away from the Noble Canyon Trailhead than Silver Peak. All that said, I was a bit apprehensive of this one. I arrived shortly after 6AM at the trailhead, and got moving quickly.\nThis same spot was filled with snow last July\nThe first mile or so is quite easy and pleasant with negligible elevation change and nice forest canopy cover. There are some great views of Noble Creek below, and the massive Silver-Highland Peak massif above. About a mile in though, the trail crosses Noble Creek. Just like when Chris and I did this the previous summer, the creek was clearly going to require getting wet to get across. I was prepared this time, so quickly rolled up my pants to above my knees, and switched my trail runners for crocs. The flow was pretty strong, and I was thankful for my hiking poles; I likely would have gone in if it weren’t for them.\nCreek crossing spot\nOnce across the creek, I opted to just walk in my crocs for a bit in order to let my feet dry out without losing any time. This worked out well, and I found a nice log to sit on a mile or so down the trail and switched back into my trail runners. I had mapped out a rib of Highland Peak that had snow on the north side, and was dry on the top and south sides. My plan was to take the dirt up, and then utilize the snow for some glissading on the way down. I had another mile or 2 of trail before I got to that rib. The trail was pretty pleasant, an occasional snow or tributary creek to cross.\nA bit further down the trail than I made it last year before heading up\nNoble Canyon really has some beautiful spots\nI made it to 1 final tributary that was at the base of my rib, and filled up my dirty bottle. One of the issues that prevented us from taking the ridge from Silver to Highland the previous summer was a lack of water, I wasn’t going to make that mistake again this year. As I started up the rib, I immediately found it to be a huge improvement over the one we took up Silver Peak. Instead of barren volcanic choss, I found myself in a nicely spaced, ancient forest of junipers and Jeffrey Pines. There were some absolute monster Junipers in this grove, some easily 8 feet in diameter or larger. It made for some pretty easy travel, and felt pretty cool to be among some trees that must easily exceed a thousand years old.\nA lovely ancient forest\nStill good snow coverage up high\nThe forest was covered in snow higher up for a bit, before giving way to a mix of low shrubs and talus. One I got to the top of the snow, I decided to leave my ice axe as it was more or less dead weight at that point. I shouldn’t actually call it my ice axe, Chris had left his much lighter ice axe in my truck after we climbed Mt Tyndall a week before, and he agreed to let me test it out for the day. The going got a bit slower from here to the ridge, as it was pretty steep, and there was a mix of loose rocks and low brush. Eventually though, the ridgeline came into sight. I aimed for the lowest point in the saddle above me as I could. There was a moderately large snow patch leading up to it, but it wasn’t very steep, and still fairly firm thankfully.\nLooking back towards Raymond and Reynolds Peaks\nNearing the saddle\nOnce at the saddle, I hung a sharp right, to the south, and started looking for what the best line up it was. The ridge between me and the summit was gradual and choked with brush about half way up, beyond that was a fairly imposing set of cliffs that I’d either need to go west of, or possibly find some easy class 3/4 moves up. I found a nice snow patch on the leeward side, which got me through a good bit of the brush. From there, I was able to stay on the ridge proper for a bit, taking some easy stair steps on solid granite. As I got closer to the cliffs, the exposure on the leeward side of the ridge grew as it opened up into a steep, snow filled bowl.\nThe ridge leading to the summit\nThe steep northeastern bowl\nI got as far as the spiny ridge would take me before it came to the vertical cliffs, and managed to find a short 30-40 foot easy class 4 route up the cliffs. There was a small bench at the top, which then led me to a small chute filled with some pretty loose rock. There were good hand holds here, so I had no issues with it. From there, it was just a short ridge walk to get to the top, with 1 small false summit composed of a steep rock outcropping.\nSome easy class 3-4 moves, these can be bypassed to the west\nI topped out around 10:20AM to clear skies and a fantastic view of the surrounding area. I could see a variety of other peaks I recognized, such as the Sweetwaters, Round Top, Mokelumne Peak, Raymond and Reynolds Peaks, the Freel-Jobs Massif, and many more. Somebody had made a pretty nice laser etched sign with the name of the peak, and a pretty woefully inaccurate elevation. The sign showed an elevation of 11,099, which is nearly 200’ of extra elevation. Thats a long way to hike a sign without taking the effort to confirm the elevation. Perhaps there was some new geological survey that I’m unaware of, but I highly doubt that.\nSome easy class 3-4 moves, these can be bypassed to the west\nNearly to the top\nI sat down in the cozy summit rock shelter and enjoyed a nice lunch of a bagel sandwich with leftover steak, and a bag of Flamin Hot Cheddar Ruffles, truly the Wheaties of the mountaineering community. I hung out for a good half hour, enjoying the view, and making sure to let my wife know I had made it.\nSummit Panorama\nThe woefully inaccurate sign somebody carried up there. Thankfully for them, its just thin Poplar\nA nice relaxing lunch spot\nI set off and planned to head back more or less the exact way I had come up, at least until my ice axe. I did end up going around the class 4 cliffs to the west, as downclimbing is neither as safe, nor as fun aWhen I got back to the snow patch at the top of the ridge, I did end up detouring a bit further north than the way I had come up. This worked out well as I was able to stay on the still fairly firm snow a bit longer. The next section down to my ice axe was not a ton of fun. I felt like I was going in slow motion as I carefully tried to pick my way through the steep field of rock and bushes. THe route finding in this kind of terrain is much more difficult while descending, as you can’t really see the route as well as you can when its right in your face.\nSlow going on the descent\nThankfully I made it to the ice axe without any issues, and prepared myself for some standing skiing, or as the french call it, glissading. I packed one of my poles away on my pack, and went with the ice axe in my right hand, and trekking pole in my left. This worked really well, and I actually did end up needing to self arrest one time, although a slide here wouldn’t have had much consequence. I shot myself down about 800’ of elevation here in just a few minutes. At the base of the snow, I cut back towards my route, which was a bit to the south. This spit me out back in the ancient grove of trees, which I took a bit more time to enjoy on the return.\nEnjoying some glissading\nAfter some time enjoying the massive trees, I ended up a bit south of my ascent route, and followed the tributary creek back down to the trail. I made it to the trail, and walked perhaps a quarter mile where I found a nice log to sit on and shake some duff and pebbles out of my shoes. From there, it was just an easy, uneventful walk along the Noble Canyon Trail. I never saw another soul the entire day out there, which to me, is a sign I’m doing the right hikes. The creek once again had a surprisingly strong current, but I made it across with no issues. I again kept my crocs on, which I kept on all the way back to the truck, arriving just a few minutes shy of 2PM.\nA monster Juniper with me for scale\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

The sno park had already started its transformation into a campsite parking lot for the summer, made evident by the “Campground Parking Only” signs posted at about half of the parking spots. I made sure to find one without that sign, saddled up my skis on my pack, and began walking up Blackwood Canyon Road.\nAround 3/4 of a mile down the road, I cut through the forest to a section of the ridge that I had identified as not too steep on my map. The wall of the canyon was soon in front of me, and I instantly found myself questioning why I do this for a hobby. Despite my internal struggle, I continued up, trying my best to find a decent route that stuck to rocky terrain. A small amount of bushwhacking ensued, but I was triumphant and topped out on the ridge around 8AM. I stopped briefly to get some sunscreen on, as well as eat a small snack, and set my course to the west, towards Twin Peaks.\nShortly after leaving the paved road\nThe ridge was snow free for the most part where I gained it, at around 7300’, but that quickly changed. I picked up a mountain bike trail, which I was able to follow briefly before the snow became deep and mostly continuous around 7500’. From that point, I was just relying on a visual cues and a general sense of direction through the snow. This isn’t very hard on a ridge, as it only goes in 2 directions. I came across a road not too far beyond there, and was able to use that a bit as a nice clear path through the trees, but found it meandered a bit too much for my taste, and cut a lot of the corners out. Just east of Stanford Rock, there was a fairly steep slope that the road went around, but again, I just cut straight through. The snow around this elevation started getting quite deep, and there were essentially no dry patches at this point.\nThis made me question if bringing skis was a good idea\nThe snow coverage did get much better atop the ridge\nI passed by Stanford Rock, deciding to save that for my return trip, despite being pretty close to it. The ridge then did a bit of a frustrating drop down about a hundred feet, then back up to around 8400 feet. Following that, it dropped yet again around another 300 feet, before flattening out a bit below Twin Peaks. I passed a TRT blaze at one point, and realized that I must have been in this exact place a few summers ago when I did this section of the TRT. The slopes again got a bit steeper, and the snow a bit deeper. It still felt like spring out here, despite it feeling more like summer at the trailhead.\nA familiar trail blaze\nTwin Peaks showing itself\nPretty soon I crested the ridge, and the final rock pyramid of the Eastern Twin Peak came into view, with a healthy cornice above a precipitous drop leading up to it. I gave the cornice a wide berth as I walked up the last bit of snow, where I dropped my pack and poles. From there, it was a steep, but easy class II scramble up the rocks to the summit. Despite just being a big pile of what appeared to be loose rocks, the rocks were held together very well. I found hardly any loose rocks as I climbed up. I made it up pretty quickly, and found a fantastic view at the top. I could see quite a few Ogul peaks I’ve climbed, a great angle of the Crystal Range, Hell Hole Reservoir, and of course a good view of Tahoe.\nThe final rock scramble to the top\nSummit Panorama\nI hung out for a few minutes, took some pictures, and did all the other things I normally do at the top of a mountain before heading back down to my stuff. Once back at my backpack, I pulled out my foam sitting pad and enjoyed some cold leftover pizza. The purple potato pizza from Slice House in Folsom is a great, albeit unconventional pizza. I didn’t linger too long, as the snow was already softer than I had wanted it to be. There didn’t seem to be a good refreeze, which typically is the time of year I give up on skiing and snowboarding near Tahoe. I switched into my ski boots, clicked in, and started to ski down.\nLooking back at Twin Peaks after skiing a bit\nThe skiing wasn’t fantastic, but not terrible either. There were some fun, fairly open sections below Twin Peaks, although that very quickly ended, and I was back at the flat section. I skate skied as far as I could before putting skins on to get back up towards Stanford Rock. The skin up wasn’t too bad, I stuck more to the proper ridge this time and made pretty good time. I dropped my skis where the snow ended, perhaps 50 feet south of Stanford Rock. I found a very nice pair of benches there, as well as a summit register. I took a few minutes to sit down on the bench (when in Rome…), and signed the register.\nStanford Rock Benches\nI walked back over to my skis, clicked back in, and continued down. I found a few hundred vertical feet of pretty decent skiing here, weaving through some well spaced, older trees. Around 7700’, the skiing turned a bit scrappy as I did my best to connect patches, sometimes skiing on one ski to get through a section of thin snow. Around 7400’, I decided it was time to call it, and switched back into my shoes and saddled the skis back up. I opted to take the summer trail back down to the sno park for the return trip. This ended up working out quite well. I was able to keep track of the trail fairly easily, although I did lose it a few times in large snow drifts. The trail popped me out into a residential street, which I took down to briefly join the bike path along highway 89. I made it back to the sno park/campground around 2:30, making my round trip just a bit shy of 8 hours.\nBear tracks, just like I had seen across the canyon on the way down from Ellis Peak\nA vandalized log\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

This time, the trail was thawed out, and I had no issue finding the bridge with my headlamp. Once I crossed the bridge, the trail was covered in some very slick snow, compacted by the insane amount of foot traffic the trail receives. I carefully walked up the steep and slick section, and before I knew it the trail leveled off somewhat onto a bench above the creek. From there, it was somewhat uneventful for a mile or so.\nThe strangely colored sky above Tahoe\nBy about 4:15AM, I came out of the forest just above Eagle Lake. I looked up at the Milky Way, and felt a sense of wonder that I haven’t felt since my first times visiting Desolation Wilderness. The mountains, Milky Way, and the remaining traces of the (very rare for this latitude) Aurora Borealis made for a truly magical sight. I stood there for a few minutes in the total dark with my headlamp off, and just enjoyed the moment. From there, I started down towards Eagle Lake, which has a use trail along its south shore. The use trail was dry for most of the lake’s shore, but became steep and snowy for the last quarter or so. I started traversing a very steep section that led straight into the water, and quickly decided it would be wise to put on my ski boots if I didn’t want to take an unplanned swim.\nWith ski boots on, I was able to kick steps into the steep slope, and while still very slow, I was able to get to the lake’s inlet pretty safely. Once at the inlet, the route led up a narrow, aspen choked canyon with steep, nearly vertical walls. The short (perhaps a quarter mile) canyon was extremely slow going. The snow was very thin and punchy, even at 5 in the morning. I carefully picked the best route I could, making sure to avoid holes under the snow the best I could. After about 30 minutes of painfully slow movement, I exited the canyon, and made it up a much easier slope next to Upper Eagle Falls.\nThe sun rising over Eagle Lake\nUpper Eagle Falls with some great lighting\nAt the top of the falls, the snow became a lot deeper, and I stopped for a few minutes to put skins on my skis, as well as drink a Red Bull. I was tired, but so far hadn’t felt too affected by skipping an entire night of sleep. Once I started skinning, the day started feeling a lot easier. I had to find a place to cross the creek, but ended up finding a nice log/snow bridge crossing not too far ahead. A log got me across the first half of the creek to an island in the middle, and a solid looking snow bridge got me the rest of the way. From there, it was on to Lower Velma Lake for my next checkpoint.\nThe snow bridge\nThe lake was frozen still, but thawing out in areas pretty significantly. I have crossed plenty of frozen lakes, and like to think I can gauge when they’re safe pretty well. That said, I wasn’t willing to cross the middle of the lake by myself this late in the season, the ~5% chance(as I predicted it) of falling in was not worth saving the distance and effort. I instead elected to skin along the shore of the lake, still over the water, but right at the shore where it would be shallow and a lot less consequential if I were to fall in. This worked well, and I made it to the north shore of the lake in just a few minutes.\nA mostly frozen Lower Velma Lake\nLooking back down towards Lower Velma Lake\nOnce at the north shore, the snow was mostly gone, so I once again strapped skis to my back and scrambled up around a steep rock outcropping that blocked the view of the peak. After getting around the outcropping, the snow coverage became good again, and I resumed skinning. The sun was fully out at this point, so I put on some sunscreen. The route was very easy from here. I managed to find a nice continuous stretch of snow all the way to the summit outcropping. I left my skis at the base of the rocks, and topped out around 8:20AM.\nGetting close to the summit\nAt the summit, I texted my wife to let her know how the day was going, and sat down for a good bit to eat my sandwich and let the snow soften up. The views were pretty fantastic to the west, Desolation was still mostly covered in snow. I had never seen Dick’s Peak from this angle, and saw countless lines off of it that looked like fantastic skiing.\nSummit panorama\nDick’s Peak and the northern end of the Crystal Range\nI gave it until around 8:45 for the snow to soften up, and was ready to start my descent. This was my first time out on a proper pair of touring skis. I was a bit apprehensive to see how the skis performed, as I had only used them briefly on some soft snow a few weekends ago. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they performed pretty well in the semi firm spring snow. I made it down ~1300 vertical feet of snow down to Lower Velma fairly quickly. I opted to go more to the west along a ridge above the lake with more continuous snow. I did have to walk a few sections, but the skiing was still great.\nOne of many short but stout Junipers I saw\nOnce back at the lake, I had another dubious crossing to make. I had to make a quick crossing of the Velma inlet, and then another short crossing along the lake’s shore. Thankfully neither of them presented any issues, regardless, I tried my best to make it across as quickly as possible. A short bushwhack got me out above the lake, and I soon rejoined my ski tracks. Another party of what looked like 2 skiers had also descended this way (perhaps from Tallac) in the past few days, so I had plenty of tracks to follow back down to Eagle Lake. I made my last few fun turns near Upper Eagle Falls, and was back into the sketchy canyon above Eagle Lake. I skied the first half or so before taking the skis off due to thin coverage, rocks, and not wanting to lose control and ski into the creek. A hellish walk through the snow ensued, sometimes postholing up to my waist. The steep slope above Eagle Lake’s south shore was equally awful, but I made it across without any issues. I made it back to about where the use trail became mostly snow free, and stopped for a few minutes to finish my sandwich and switch back into my tennis shoes.\nMy return creek crossing, a bit more sketchy than the one from that morning\nI was quite happy with how the new skis performed\nLooking back at the hellish bushwhack canyon\nAfter that, the walk back was pretty uneventful, but quite crowded. I hadn’t seen anyone all day up to my return to Eagle Lake, but probably saw 30-40 people on my way back. I got a lot of weird looks, and surprised questions about my skis. I got stuck behind some very slow people hiking out, but made it back down to the truck shortly after noon. I think my lack of sleep, and early start ended up being a benefit, as letting the snow get much warmer would have made things significantly harder. This was by far the most adventurous and fun day so far of 2024. Hopefully many more are to come this summer.\nEagle Lake\nEmerald Bay\nRoute My route (my phone put itself into battery saver mode on the return trip, resulting in lower accuracy) GPX Track Download",

    "content": "April 27th, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nWe originally had planned to do an overnight snow camping trip in Blackwood Canyon, and climb Ellis Peak. As the date got closer, I happened to stumble upon a forest service page mentioning that overnight camping was not allowed in that area, so the plan shifted towards a day trip. Chris and I met at his house at 5:30 and loaded into his Subaru. His dog, Cal would be joining us on the trip. We arrived at the Blackwood Canyon Sno Park around 8, and walked down the bike trail to a nearby road with a fire road easement leading into the forest service land. This allowed us to bypass crossing Blackwood Creek, which may have proven difficult with the spring melt happening.\nChris and Cal near the trailhead\nWe walked a short distance up the road, and soon started directly up a steep slope towards the ridge. I had brought my splitboard this time, but just walked up this part in my tennis shoes as I didn’t quite feel like putting my boots on yet. The initial climb was pretty steep, but we made good time and soon were up on the ridge with a great view of Tahoe. Once we made it up there, I basked in the glory of the good route I had planned. This was going to be a good day.\nHeading up the steep canyon wall\nI switched over to skinning, and we set off after a short break. The route was pretty moderate in steepness, so we enjoyed a nice casual pace as we went slowly up. The fresh snow from the past 2 days was around 6 inches deep or so, but getting baked in the sun. This made for some serious snow glopping on my skins. I stopped a few times to dry my skins out and add some wax to them. It helped a lot, but it still was taxing to carry around all that extra weight on my feet.\nLooking back towards Tahoe\nWe reached the first bump in the ridge, and decided to go a bit south of the high point to avoid unnecessary elevation gain and loss. This worked out pretty well, and we soon came to a point where we could see the summit of Ellis. There was a decent sized cornice leading up this last section of the ridge ahead of us, so we opted to stay on the windward side, as there were some sections that had recently collapsed. Chris and I were both a bit worried about Cal, as he hadn’t had any water to drink that day. Chris tried his best to force Cal to drink some, but as the saying goes, “you can lead a horse to water…”.\nEllis comes into view\nThe next section was a bit steeper, and the snow got a bit deeper as well. This made things a bit more taxing, but it became clear to me that we’d probably make it to the top, which powered me forward. After a bit longer, we came to the bottom of a false summit, both of us thinking the summit was right ahead. I asked Chris if he wanted to wait here with Cal, and we could take turns going to the summit, in case Cal was getting dehydrated. Chris agreed, and I continued up. Upon getting close to the false summit, I realized what it was, and checked my CalTopo app. It turned out we were still about a quarter mile from the proper summit. I called Chris to let him know, and he informed me that Cal had continued up to follow me after taking a short break, so they were both en route.\nNearing the top of the corniced ridge\nI finally got to the base of the summit block, and skinned my way up the last steep slope, and to the summit. The view up here was fantastic, probably one of the best views of Tahoe I’ve ever seen. You can basically see the entire shoreline, which isn’t possible from many places. About 5-10 minutes later, Chris and Cal crested the horizon, and we enjoyed a nice summit lunch as a group. The weather was perfect, and we were all in great spirits. I had a nice turkey sandwich, some chips, and a Liquid Death water, pretty dang good for the top of a mountain.\nSummit panorama\nGroup summit selfie\nI switched my splitboard back over to board mode, and told Chris I’d meet him at the bottom of the slope ahead of us (he was using snowshoes). I made a few turns down it, and was back to a flat section pretty quickly. Chris and Cal caught up, and I decided I’d just split ski the rest of it rather than make a bunch of transitions. This ended up being a great idea, as the skiing was more fun for me than snowboarding would have been. We made good time on the way down without too much fanfare. There were some patches of inconsistent temperature snow, which caused me to go over backwards on my skis once, but it was a pretty mellow crash. Before long, we were back at the top of the steep section we had climbed to gain the ridge. I was a bit apprehensive about skiing something this steep on my split skis, but started off pretty mellow, taking huge wide turns down the hill. By the time we made it to the bottom, I was making much smaller turns, and having an absolute blast skiing down with Cal running right behind me. Chris made pretty good time too, doing a hybrid of jogging and glissading down the mountain.\nLooking back at Ellis after skiing down\nA small bear track close to the trailhead\nIn my excitement, I overshot the way we had come in by a bit, and we had to make a short backtrack to get to the fire road we came in on. Once at the start of the fire road, we opted to stash our gear there in an inconspicuous spot, and come grab it with the car. We made the ~1.5 mile walk back on the road, and came back to grab the gear. On the way back, we stopped off in Meyers for burritos, a tradition I’ve become quite fond of.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

I took the day off about a month in advance, and with my luck it happened to land on a day with some weather in the forecast. Due to this, I made the call to take a trip up north where the snow doesn’t fall as deep as it does closer to Tahoe. The roads weren’t too bad, and I was at the Gold Lake Staging area by 6:45AM. The snow was basically gone at that elevation, so I decided to leave the skis in my truck for the day, and just focus on going light and fast.\nDrizzly conditions in the parking lot\nI walked up the Gold Lake Highway about a mile before making a right turn towards the lodge. The road was pretty easy going, with only a few patches of snow on it. As soon as I got off the road towards the lodge however, the snow became more of an obstacle. After a brief jaunt through the forest, I was faced with my first decision of the day. Bushwhack up a steep slope filled with wet manzanita, or detour about a mile around on the summer trail (which was mostly covered in snow). I opted for the former, which was not the most pleasant thing I’ve ever done.\nMaking my way up the highway\nLooking up at the bushwhack ahead of me\nAs I had predicted, the manzanita filled slope was soaking wet from the rain it had gotten the night before. I used my poles to try and knock water off of the bushes ahead of me, but still ended up completely soaked by the time I made it up the few hundred vertical feet. With imminent snow, this seemed slightly risky, but I trusted my gear, and had dry layers if I needed them.\nUp on the ridge\nNow that I was up on the ridge, the snow got a lot deeper, but the going was much easier. The overcast made it difficult to tell exactly where the peak was, so I relied on CalTopo on my phone to point me in the right direction. After 30-40 minutes, I was above Hidden Lake, which was still mostly frozen over, but probably not enough to walk on. I chose the best route I could up the steep slopes above the lake, opting for a more direct route than the summer trail which meanders a bit to the west.\nLooking up towards the peak from near Hidden Lake\nHidden Lake starting to thaw out\nOnce on top of the steep slopes above the lake, I entered a fairly dense section of forest, and had very little idea of where the peak was based on visual cues. CalTopo guided me once again, and I managed to find a pretty efficient route up towards the top. By about 9:40, I could see what I was pretty sure was the summit.\nThe false summit\nUpon reaching it, I realized that it was a false summit, and I had a small way to go still. The summit block had some very winter like snow and conditions, and made me slightly regret not bringing the skis. I topped out around 9:48AM, and was somewhat disappointed with the amount of overcast blocking what is probably a great view on a clear day. No luck finding a summit register either, but thats fairly common in the snow. I hung out for a few minutes, took some pictures, ate some snacks, and planned a more efficient route back down.\nSummit panorama\nOn the way down, I veered to the east of Hidden Lake. This took me down the same slope I had bushwhacked down, but on a more snowy section of it. This ended up working out very well, I was able to jog/glissade down the majority of it and make great time. Near the bottom, things got a bit more tricky as the snow coverage became thinner. The valley down there is full of aspens and small creeks, making for tricky navigation, with lots of postholing.\nPostholing my way down\nBack down by the creek\nBefore too long, I was back near the lodge, and somehow missed the way I took in, and ended up having to walk through knee deep water to get back to the road. The water was frigid, but it seemed easier than backtracking and postholing around through the Aspens. Once through the water, it was a short walk back to the road, and then just a simple walk from there.\nMy final obstacle\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

The forecasted weather made me question if there would be much of a refreeze, so I wanted to get an early start. I was at the trailhead at Pickett Junction around 5AM. I loaded up all of my gear, and set off in my running shoes, hoping that the snow would be supportive enough to walk on.\nAspens along Burnside Lake Road\nThe snow ended up being moderately frozen still, and supportive enough to walk on. I walked up Burnside lake road for a few miles without incident. The snow coverage was still pretty good for late April, but there were a few dry patches that I knew would be annoying when I returned on skis. After about 2 miles, the sun had come out and I veered to the east off of the road and up towards the ridge that connects Pickett and Hawkins Peaks.\nView to the west from my way up to the ridge\nThe snow was a mixed bag once I got off of the road, but never too punchy. I debated switching to skinning a few times, but was making great time in my shoes so just kept on going. Pickett Peak came into view after a while, and I used that to orient my direction more to the south, towards Hawkins Peak.\nPickett Peak in the morning light\nEventually the forest in front of my gave way to more and more blue sky, and I was on top of the ridge. From here, Hawkins Peak was easy to see, and frankly, a bit intimidating looking. I walked down a dirt road atop the ridge for a bit, before deciding to take a quick break to put on sunscreen, eat a cookie, and mix some electrolytes in my water bottle.\nHawkins comes into view\nAfter my break, I continued down the road, the snow was mostly gone at the top of the ridge, despite both sides still having pretty continuous snow cover. The road made a small dip down, and then back up to a decent sized snow field. I had a few options here, I could cross the snowfield to the southeast, or continue south, and climb up another connecting ridge towards the summit block. The former option seemed easier, and had more continuous snow coverage, so I opted to take that one.\nI enjoyed the respite of a brief downhill section, but once again, the route went back up a somewhat gentle slope towards the summit. I picked up some sort of tracks that I assume must have been a snow cat. I thought it was a snowmobile track at first, but it seemed too wide, and it seemed to look more like it had tracks on both sides, rather than just one in the middle. I continued following this until I got to a decent sized stand of trees, and decided to just go straight through the trees.\nFollowing what looked like snow cat tracks\nThe trees seemed to be pretty old and tired from years of sitting up there, exposed to the wind. To the east was a fairly large collection of solar panels, which I can only guess have to do with the communications tower on top of the peak. The snow at this elevation was extremely firm, as well as wind affected. I knew the ride down wasn’t going to be great. After getting across the stand of trees, the summit was a short snowfield, and another short rock scramble away.\nLooking back down at the tired old stand of trees and some solar panels\nI crossed the snow, which became slightly precarious as it was still in the shade. I dropped my pack at the rocks, and just took my poles to scramble up the rocks to the summit.\nThe summit had some incredible views, despite the big ugly communications tower. I could see other nearby and somewhat distant peaks that I had climbed in virtually every direction. I walked around a bit, and found the summit register a bit south of the tower. I signed my name, and spent a few minutes taking pictures and soaking in the view before descending the rocks back towards my stuff. From there, I set up my splitboard and started making my way down the horrendous snow.\nSummit Panorama\nView to the south\nThe snow at the top was barely edgeable, and my hard boots sent every tiny vibration through my legs. I love how light the setup is, but it feels terrible on snow that firm. I cautiously worked my way down, and found the corn snow starting to ripen around 9k feet. I straight lined it down the last slope, which got me across perhaps 100 yards of flat terrain, and a moderate way up a small slope I needed to climb to gain the ridge. From there, I disassembled the splitboard, and carried the skis on my backpack as I walked back up to the ridge.\nTaking a break from the leg numbing bulletproof snow\nOnce up on the ridge, I walked a short way, and decided to take a route slightly to the south of where I had come up. The snow was more continuous here, and it wouldn’t really add any mileage. I opted to split ski this, as the snow was nice and soft, and not too steep. The skiing was actually a lot more fun than the snowboarding had been. I followed a set of tracks down from what looked like a party of 2 skiers, and a dog from a week or so ago. The route followed the spine of a ridge for about a quarter mile, before dropping back into the forest above Burnside Lake Road.\nSkiing down along some other recent tracks\nAfter a bit of zig zagging through aspens, I was back on Burnside Lake Road, and knew the rest of the trip was going to be pretty easy. I put on some music, and enjoyed the cruise down the snowy road. The snow was pretty soft and slow down there, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. A few dry patches were a bit annoying, but I crossed over them without too much fanfare. As I was pulling back into the parking lot, I ran into a man and woman that were on there way out. We chatted for a few minutes, and I made my way back to the truck to get my ski boots off, and decide where in Meyers I would go get a burrito (I settled on Sombreros).\nRoute GPX Track Download",

The weather was pretty cool and gloomy for August, but as someone who doesn’t enjoy heat, it was a welcome change for me. The drive out was a bit long, but pleasant. I really like the section of Highway 89 that’s north of Truckee. We saw one other group getting ready at the trailhead, but set off before they did. My Dad, as well as my Dog George were joining me for this hike.\nGeorge leading the charge\nThe trail has some fairly significant elevation gain in the first few miles, and I quickly found myself wondering why the hell I chose this hobby. No matter how much I train, and how many peaks I climb, walking uphill out of the gate always catches me off guard. In spite of my uphill suffering, George was having a great time in this new place, and the charm of the volcanic forest started to grow on me as well. The trail meandered along Cold Stream for a bit, before swinging to the east a bit and joining a forest service road for a short distance.\nCold Stream\nA gloomy morning for August\nA mile or 2 later, the trail took us through Cold Stream Meadow, which had some nice views of the Lola Ridge, as well as abundant plant life. I tried explaining that meadows are sensitive habitats in the Sierra, but he decided to roll on his back in the grass despite my explanation. After the meadow, the trail went through a bit more forested land before starting to make its way up the ridge proper. The trail was pretty well graded, and quite well used and easy to follow, despite the thick fog as we got closer to the top. Some impressive snow drifts still clung on, which seemed rare for the elevation and time of year.\nCold stream meadow\nHeading up\nEventually the trail topped out on the ridge, but still a bit shy of Mt Lola’s summit. George again took some time out to roll in the snow, he didn’t seem to mind the wind and somewhat cold temperatures. The guy likes to roll in snow regardless of the conditions. The trail continued west and slightly south, and the fog grew thicker and the wind faster. We plodded along, and before too long were at the fairly unimpressive (at least when shrouded in fog) summit of Mt Lola. There were some interesting brick wall sections, and a pretty weathered and old looking sign to mark the spot.\nSnow drift on the ridge\nNearing the summit\nWe hung out in the rock shelter on the summit and ate our lunch, signed the register, and did all of the other standard summit things one does. I was a bit disappointed with the fog obscuring what I’m sure is a great view, but thats just a good excuse to come back on a clear day again. After a sufficient rest, we started making our way back to the car.\nSummit sign\nWe stopped again in the meadow to inspect some of the plants a bit closer. Upon returning and doing some searches, it appears that Corn Lily, which is quite deadly, dominates a good part of the meadow. George had been eating some grass right by these plants, but he’s managed to survive, so thankfully probably didn’t eat any of it. We stopped and talked to a few hikers heading out towards Lola at the end of the meadow, and continued on our way back. The rest of the return trip was pretty uneventful, but good training for our upcoming JMT section we had planned the following week.\nWildflowers in Cold Stream Meadow\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

    "content": "August 13th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy dad joined me for Mt Mildred, and we decided to approach it from the Hell Hole side. Its a bit closer to where we live, and seemed like the less traveled route. I mapped out the route the best I could from blindly looking at forest service topo maps, and we drove my truck as far as we could up an old forest service road below Chipmunk Ridge, which leads towards the western flank of Mt Mildred. From where we parked, there was no trail, nor did we really ever find one all day. However, the ridge seemed like it would make navigating somewhat easy. We bushwhacked a bit up a steep hill, and gained the ridge in perhaps 20-30 minutes.\nLooking towards McKinstry Peak from where we gained the ridge\nTypical walking conditions on Chipmunk Ridge\nOnce we were up on the ridge, the navigating indeed was pretty simple, we could see a good distance ahead of us along the crumbling volcanic ridge, and off towards the Granite Chief Wilderness to the east. We made our way along the ridge with relative ease, although there were some short but intense bursts of bushwhacking occasionally. For the most part though, it was just easy walking along the volcanic ridgetop. Mule’s Ears apparently are quite fond of the soil up in that area, although they were past their blooming prime. I’d imagine its a great place to visit during the height of them flowering.\nMildred coming into view\nThe ridge made a few dips, but generally continued in an upward direction, at times leading us through some rocky outcroppings. Around 10AM, we came to the first of 2 rock “monuments”, which I had seen on the map. I was expecting some sort of plaque, but instead what we found was a big volcanic plug sticking out of the ground. 20 minutes later or so, we came across the second monument, named the Johnson Monument on my maps. This one was far more impressive, easily nearing 100 feet tall. After admiring it for a bit, we continued up the steepening ridge towards Mildred, which was coming into view nicely.\nThe first smaller monument\nThe Johnson Monument\nAs we neared the final slopes up Mildred, we saw that there was an inevitable bushwhack ahead, and it did not disappoint. We struggled up a steep slope with 3-4 foot deep bushes, swimming uphill for a hundred yards or so. Once we got to the top, the going got easier, and it was just a simple walk to the summit. The summit had some great views towards Desolation Wilderness to the south, towards Castle Peak to the North, Hell Hole to the west, and east into the Granite Chief Wilderness. We hung out for a good 30 minutes and ate lunch while soaking it in. Inside the summit register, we found some pretty old signatures, including one from Pete Yamagata, who had placed it back in 1995. The register was clear evidence that this summit does not see a lot of traffic.\nMy dad making his way up the hellish bushwhack\nHell Hole on the left, French Meadows on the right\nSummit Panorama\nFor the descent, we decided to swing to the north a bit, and check out a feature named “Heaven’s Gate” on the map. Heaven’s Gate is a formation of basalt columns in the col below Mildred. It forms an opening in the col, somewhat similar to Devil’s Postpile, but with more of a “gate” shape. The route reconnecting us to Chipmunk Ridge from there was actually a good bit easier, we bypassed the bushwhacking, and instead just got to walk through some fairly mature and well spaced trees. We found a nice patch of snow at one point, and I stopped to fill an empty bottle with it so that I could make one of my trademark electrolyte slushees. We soon got back to the ridge and retraced our steps back the way we came.\nHeaven’s Gate\nMy Snow Slushee\nThe return trip was fairly uneventful and easy. We made pretty good time, but were definitely a bit tired of dealing with all of the bushes and deadfall by the end of it. Before too long though, we were back at the point where we had gained the ridge, and made the easy walk down through the dense forest and to my truck, enjoying a nice field of Mule’s Ear right at the end of the hike.\nThe field of Mule’s Ears\nRoute GPX Track Download",

Its a bit closer to where we live, and seemed like the less traveled route. I mapped out the route the best I could from blindly looking at forest service topo maps, and we drove my truck as far as we could up an old forest service road below Chipmunk Ridge, which leads towards the western flank of Mt Mildred. From where we parked, there was no trail, nor did we really ever find one all day. However, the ridge seemed like it would make navigating somewhat easy. We bushwhacked a bit up a steep hill, and gained the ridge in perhaps 20-30 minutes.",

It wasn’t terrible, but definitely was slow going and quite dusty and bumpy. When we arrived, there were quite a few more cars than I had expected, turns out there’s a campground out there thats fairly popular. There was even a Honda Civic that had somehow managed to pull a trailer out there. Mad respect to that guy, he either knows a better route, or is quite the skilled driver.\nGreat views near the trailhead\nWe found a place to park, and were on the trail around 8:45AM. The trail starts at a point where a few ridges meet, so the views were instantly pretty great, we could see the Black Buttes off in the distance. About a mile or so in, we made a wrong turn, and had descended all the way to the shore of Downey Lake before I realized out mistake. George was more than willing to make the best of the situation, and went for a swim in the lake. After George was content with his swimming, we made the small climb back up to the trail.\nDowney Lake\nA brief detour at Downey Lake\nGeorge Enjoying a nice meadow\nFrom there, the trail was relatively easy and mellow. Staying moderately flat, and with a pretty consistent forest canopy to keep us out of the sun. Eventually we came to the Sand Ridge and Grouse Lake trail junction, and went to the right, towards Glacier Lakes. The route became bit more sunny, and we walked through some nice meadows before starting a moderate ascent up to Glacier Lakes. We crossed a few more creeks, which George was happy to swim in and cool off. Before long, the Black Buttes came back into view, and we were at Glacier Lake. We walked around the lake a bit to try to find a good way up, and George once again went for a swim. I found a decent looking route that went directly up a chute above the lake to a saddle just shy of the summit. My wife and George decided to hang out here while I made a quick dash for the summit.\nLooking up the chute towards the peak\nThe chute was fairly easy, pretty deep but supportive (for late July) snow up the lower half, which turned into a class 3 rock scramble a bit higher up. I made pretty good time, and was soon at the saddle. I couldn’t quite tell which one was the summit, so I first went to the east one. I got to the high point over there, and quickly realized that the west one was actually the proper summit. So I doubled back, and made another short scramble up to the top of the West Summit, which was clearly higher. Most maps seem to indicate the Eastern point being the summit, but that phenomenon seems pretty common on the Ogul Peaks. I didnt find a register (although in hindsight I’m sure there’s one somewhere), so I placed one that I carry around just in case on the Western summit.\nSummit Panorama\nLooking back down from the saddle\nAs I made my way down, I struck up a quick conversation with some folks over on the Eastern summit, they seemed to agree that the West one was clearly higher. Regardless, I made my way over there just to be certain that I had tagged the proper peak. I made quick work of the climb back down the chute, and enjoyed a nice glissade (does is count as a glissade if you’re sitting on your butt?) back down to my wife and dog near the lake. We started making our way back down the trail after a few minutes of rest. About a mile down the trail, we found a nice log to sit on and eat lunch. I enjoyed one of my favorite mountain lunches, a bag of chips and a roast beef sandwich.\nGeorge eagerly leading the way back\nThe walk back was somewhat long, but mostly uneventful.

Instead of going all the way to the pass, we parked a few turns east of it, at the Noble Lake Trailhead. We knew it was going to be somewhat hot, and definitely a struggle to get up based on what we had read about this route. Silver Peak is also an interesting Ogul peak in that the slightly lower southwest summit is the Ogul Peak, but not the high point.\nSilver Peak from the Trailhead\nWe got started and the first few miles of the trail were pretty pleasant. Nicely forested, and mostly flat. After a mile or 2, we came across a pretty massive avalanche path that had created a huge mess of a stand of trees. Considering the size of the trees it knocked over, this seemed to be a fairly rarely powerful avalanche for the area. We navigated our way through the carnage, and soon were at Noble Creek, which we forded with our shoes off.\nAvalanche destruction\nCreek Crossing\nBeyond the Creek, we walked perhaps another mile or so, before deciding to start cutting up towards Silver Peak off the trail. I don’t know if we picked a very good spot (it seems like a pretty inhospitable ridge in general), but we were struggling up chossy steep slopes in no time. At a certain point, the choss gave way to bushwhacking for a few hundred yards, accompanied by a healthy population of mosquitos. Chris very much was ready to bail at this point (he hates mosquitos, and they seem to love him), but I managed to convince him to give it some more time. We eventually got above the bushwhack, and made our way into a snow filled drainage. This made things marginally easier, as the snow surface was pretty consistent and firm still. We managed to gain a few thousand feet up this drainage before finally leaving it and cutting over to talus higher up.\nSnow filed drainage we followed up\nFurther up the drainage\nSwitching over to talus\nThe talus was probably the easiest surface we had walked on in hours, and we made pretty good time up it. Before long, we could see the 2 summits of Silver Peak. We made it up to the low point in the ridge between the 2, and decided to head for the lower of the 2, the southeast summit, first. This one somehow beat out the Northwest summit for the Ogul list, I’m not sure why as its clearly lower. We hung out for a bit on the summit, and ate some lunch and checked out the contents of the register. There was a huge clump of old wet registers, as well as some weed that someone left in the register (its probably unwise to use random summit register drugs, but thats a personal choice).\nAt the saddle just north of the southwest summit\nSummit Panorama\nWe eventually made our way back down to the saddle, and stopped for a bit there to refill our water from the snowfield there. I had somewhat underestimated the heat, and amount of water I’d need, so I was thankful for the big snow year. We then made our way to the proper summit, took in the views, signed the register, and were back off towards the trailhead.\nLooking towards the NE summit\nNE proper summit panorama\nChis on the summit\nWe opted for a slightly more northern route this time, we could see some more open rolling terrain in that direction that looked a lot more friendly than the way we had come up. Getting to that more gentle terrain didn’t come cheap though. We navigated down through a whole plethora of conditions. Extremely steep and deep snow, hazardously loose and steep rock, random clumps of thick forest, this descent had it all. It was a struggle the whole way down, but we managed to have a good time and laugh a bit at how bad the conditions were.\nWe aimed for the half moon shaped moraine\nWildflowers lower down\nEventually we made it down to the more open terrain we had spotted from above, and enjoyed a nice stretch of fairly easy walking. At this point, we were a few hundred feet above the floor of Noble Canyon, but the bottom of the slope was going to be tricky. The slope dropped off dramatically, and was entirely covered in small loose volcanic rock, on top of extremely hard packed (and steep) terrain. We slowly picked a route through the volcanic choss pile, and ended up back on the trail a bit closer to the trailhead than where we had diverted from it that morning. We enjoyed the easy trail walk back to the car, and were back by around 4:45 PM.\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

This was a good opportunity to take a nice drive together, as well as a nice hike. We left home around 7, and stopped for bagels in Auburn before getting on highway 49 towards Nevada City. I had never taken 49 beyond Grass Valley, and it was a nice drive. We passed through Downieville and decided we’d stop there on the way back to check it out.\nWe stopped briefly in Sierra City to use the restroom, and talked with a French Woman who was doing the PCT (the trekking poles and sun hoodie were a dead giveaway). We then did the last leg of the drive up to the Sierra Buttes Trailhead. Upon arriving, I was amazed at how many mountain bikers were up there, being unaware of the Downieville classic at the time. The gate where we started our hike from\nThe Buttes coming into view\nWe got started around 10, and it was pretty warm right away. Thankfully, there was still a ton of snow lingering, and we both packed some into our hats to cool off. The trail went along a pretty sunny ridge towards the south for a bit, before heading back into the trees. In the forest, it was mostly snow with some occasional patches of dirt. We passed quite a few groups of people going up and down the trail, it was clearly a very popular destination.\nLingering snow in the trees\nEventually the forest opens up to a fire road that leads up to the summit and fire lookout. We were back in the sun, but it didn’t feel quite as hot up there. The snow was also less of an issue. After wrapping around to the east and some switchbacks, we arrived at the base of the staircase leading to the lookout. The stairs were very well built, and very steep. I don’t think they followed the standard 7 inch rise and 11 inch run of most stairs. We made it up them, and found that we had the lookout to ourselves.\nThe fire road leading to the summit\nThe lookout and stairs that lead up to it\nAfter taking some pictures and enjoying the views, we sat down and enjoyed a nice lunch of cold pizza from the night before. We headed down, and I signed the register, having to find a blank space many pages back from the end of it, because it was completely full. I walked around the base of the lookout a bit, and found a few benchmarks. We then went back down the stairs, and got back onto the fire road.\nLooking down towards Sardine Lakes\nThe walk back down was pretty quick and easy, I showed off my glissading skills at every opportunity, sometimes going out of my way to get onto the snow. We lost the trail at one point for a bit, but got ourselves back on track without much trouble. We were back in the car by around 12:45 PM. Looking down the way we came up\nOn the way home, we stopped and checked out Downieville. The entire town was full of mountain bikers and tourists. It’s cool to see an old gold rush town like that figure out a niche and manage to still have a pretty vibrant economy for where it is. After Downieville, we stopped again on the side of 49 to go swim in the Downie River. It was a lot of driving, but a very pleasant day out exploring Northern California.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

Lookout Peak seemed to fit the bill nicely, it didn’t look too difficult on paper. The road to the Pacific Valley Campground was still snowed in, so I parked right by highway 4. This would add a few miles, but they were all easy flat miles. I was walking by 6:45, and was immediately impressed by how much snow was still there. It seemed that this area was pretty well shaded, causing the snow to linger for quite some time.\nSnow conditions near the start\nAn old Corral and cabin a few miles in\nI walked quickly, being slowed down by the large mounds of snow I’d have to go up and down every few hundred feet. There were dry patches of ground mixed in, but they seemed to be the minority. After a mile or so, I passed some old buildings and a corral, and the Pacific Valley Campground not far beyond that. The road went on for several more miles, it was in a precarious state as the snow bridges were starting to get thin, with a lot of water moving underneath. Eventually, the road fizzled out, and the trail started, which seemed to almost immediately cross Pacific Creek.\nPacific Valley Trailhead\nThe creek was moving pretty well, and fording it was my only choice. I took my shoes and socks off, and endured the frigid waters to get across. On the other side, I used the sleeves of my sun hoodie to dry my feet off as much as possible, and continued west up the trail. From here, the snow got even deeper, making the trail very difficult to follow. The drifts were easily 15 feet deep in some places still, pretty impressive for below 8000 feet in July. After struggling with this for long enough, I decided to ignore all of the trip reports I had read, and cut directly up towards the summit.\nEndless snow along the shaded trail\nThis ended up being a great choice, after a few hundred yards, the forest opened up, which had allowed the sun and wind to dissipate the snow. I was back on solid ground, and the hike was pretty straightforward from there. I went up and up, and soon broke through the last of the trees, following a dried out drainage towards the summit. I crossed one last patch of snow, and was at the base of a talus field below the summit.\nMuch better conditions upslope from the trail\nJust below the summit\nAfter negotiating the talus, the summit was a short ridge walk away. I found the register, and signed my name. The view was pretty spectacular on Lookout Peak, I could see as far north as Desolation Wilderness, and as far south as what looked like Sonora Pass. I hung out for 10-15 minutes before heading back down, still trying to make good time. I had set myself a goal of making it back by 1PM, but realized that I could probably be at my truck by 11AM or so.\nSummit Panorama\nI more or less followed my route back down at first, but ended up veering more to the north, which saved me a lot of slow movement through the snow down below. This put me back on the trail pretty close to the Pacific Creek crossing, which had picked up a bit since the morning. After that, it was just tedious (but quick) walking through the snowdrifts along the road. It was pretty uneventful, and I made it back to the truck just a few minutes after 11.

It was a bit far from Ebbett’s Pass, but I had wanted somewhere with service so I could get some info for the next day. I packed up my camp, and drove to Ebbett’s Pass. The road to Ebbett’s Pass is pretty interesting, it completely forgoes the yellow line, and is about 1.5 cars wide over the top. I made it to the pass around 6:45 and crossed the road to find the PCT.\nEbett’s Pass\nI was a bit west of the PCT proper, so ended up fumbling around through the snow for a bit. The small valley I was in smelled badly of a dead animal, so I did my best to get above it, and soon linked up with the trail. Reynolds Peak came into view, and it definitely looked a bit intimidating. There was still quite a bit of snow here, which made for tricky navigation, and I knew that the afternoon would be interesting once it got a bit warmer.\nEbett’s Peak Coming into View\nReynolds Peak (slightly left of center)\nI found patches of the PCT here and there, but was mostly relying on footprints, and occasionally checking CalTopo to stay on course. This took me along the side of Upper Kinney Lake, where I started cutting off to the northwest towards the ridge that leads to Reynolds Peak. The start of the ridge was pretty pleasant, and thankfully mostly free of snow. I made good time up it, and was soon up around 9000 feet. Heading up the Ridge\nLooking back towards the Highland/Silver Peak Massif\nFrom here, things got a bit more tricky. I needed to go a good distance, but the top of the ridge was not going to be a good place to walk. I opted to stay below the top, which meant a lot of chossy sidehilling. The entire time, I was well aware that rockfall was a common thing here, so I tried my best to stay a good distance below the steep vertical stuff.\nThe slow, slippery traverse\nReynolds Peak from the North\nI stayed on the west side of the ridge, and a few hundred feet below the top most of the way over to Reynolds. As I got closer, the mountain looked more and more imposing. I knew not to be too worried, as I couldn’t see the route from this side. After a lot of precarious walking on what felt like ball bearings, I arrived at the base of the class 3 section leading to the summit. I dropped my pack and poles near the base of the climb and headed up.\nThe class 3 section was a bit exposed, but very easy. The holds were all solid, and none of the moves were very difficult. The crux of the climb was probably a large boulder near the top that one has to either go over or around, I chose to go over it. I made it to the summit quickly, snapped a few pictures, and sat down to sign the register.\nJust below the summmit\nThe register went back to 1984, Pete Yamagata and some other Sierra Club members had placed it. Pete’s name comes up all over the place in Tahoe area registers, and I’ve used his website for information more than once. I flipped through the pages, and added my own entry before heading back down the way I came up.\nSummit Panorama\nAfter picking my backpack and poles back up, I started to retrace my route back towards Upper Kinney Lake. I tried staying a bit higher on the ridge this time, which in hindsight made things a bit trickier than they needed to be. I came across several more technical downclimbs, most between class 3 and at worst easy class 4. One of which had a rock come loose, which caused me to painfully bang my shin on the rock. Before too long though, I was back at the saddle between Reynolds and Peak 9520.\nPeak 9520\nI had considered using this spot to drop down to the meadow below, but upon further inspection, it was still quite snowy, and the snow would be soft by this time of day. Instead, I set my sights on peak 9520, which I had walked under on the way in. The peak looked like it might be too difficult to do without a rope, but I had to try to find out. The very top block looked quite imposing from below, but I figured it may have a weakness like Reynolds does.\nI followed the ridge up, and got to the base of the big block without much trouble. The block ended up having a decent looking crack going up it, it looked to be a class 4 climb with a bit of exposure, but it was only about a 25-30 foot drop or so. I decided to go for it, climbing the first half or so with ease. At that point, I got to a more difficult move, and paused for a moment. I was close to turning back, but something told me to go for it, so I did. I easily climbed up it, and was on the top in short order.\nThe route up Peak 9520\nPeak 9520 Summit Panorama\nI looked briefly, but didn’t see a register, so I snapped a few pictures and decided to downclimb while I still had some adrenaline from the climb up. The downclimb was pretty easy, the same crux didn’t give me any issues once I knew I had gone up it. I got to the base, and once again saddled up my backpack and poles to continue down.\nI stopped in a vertical meadow above Kinney Lake to enjoy my southwestern salad for lunch, spending a good 20-30 minutes relaxing. It was a beautiful spot for a nice leisurely lunch. After I finished eating, I continued down towards the PCT, picking it up a bit further than I had taken it that morning. The snow was thankfully not as soft as I was worried it would be, but still made route finding difficult.\nLunch with a view\nI made good time back towards Ebbett’s pass, stopping only to figure out where the PCT was underneath all of the snow. Around Sherrold Lake I heard a distinct buzzing noise in the sky, and saw a drone flying above me.

Jed was planning to head home after this one, and I was planning to stay out a few more nights. Wanting to get another double summit day, we decided on Genoa and Duane Bliss Peaks. They aren’t nearly as exciting as the other peaks we had done recently, but it would also allow us to knock out one of our last remaining sections of the TRT. Jed and I met at Spooner summit, and we got into his car to drive to the Daggett Trailhead.\nNear the Daggett Trailhead\nWe left the Daggett trailhead somewhere around 7:30AM, and enjoyed a nice easy walk in the shade to get started. This section of the TRT is known for being pretty hot and dry, so I was glad to be doing it in a high snow year. The first few miles were relatively uneventful. Jed took the lead, and I plodded along at a somewhat leisurely pace, trying to save my legs for a few more days of this. The trail was mostly forested, with occasional views of the lake.\nLake Tahoe and Mt Tallac in the distance\nAfter a few miles, we cut off the trail onto a dirt road towards Genoa Peak. We followed the road, which went all the way to the summit of Genoa. The road was mostly in the sun, making for a pretty hot climb. Before too long though, we came to the top of the road, just below the summit. There was a generator here, which must be used to power the communication tower on top. The noise of the generator really seemed to take some of the ambiance away from the peak. We climbed a trail up the last little bit, and made it to the top.\nAbout mid way up the push to the summit\nSummit Panorama\nThe top of the mountain is dominated by the communication tower, and whoever maintains the tower leaves a huge mess. There was construction debris all over the place, and it was impossible to get a good panorama with the giant tower in the way. Neither of us could find a register anywhere. We didn’t hang out for too long before heading down.\nBack on the road, a family in 2 side by side UTVs had come up. We said hello, and continued down the road, heading back towards the TRT. This cut off a small section of the trail, but I say it still counts if you’re climbing higher than the trail itself. We made it back to the trail shortly. Not long after, we started to encounter some deep snow. It was firm and easy to walk on, but difficult to find the trail. I pulled my phone out a few times and used CalTopo to get us back on track. After the snow had dissipated, I stopped and talked to a lady and her husband who were doing the TRT endurance run in a few weeks. They were from Fresno, so I gave them what info I could on the trail.\nA bench with a nice view\nWe continued on for another few miles, before cutting off onto another dirt road towards Duane Bliss Peak.We then turned onto a trail, which ended up going in the wrong direction. We decided to just bushwack our way over rather than double back, and soon were at a small pond at the base of the climb. The climb was hot and steep, but like Genoa, was over quickly. I found this summit to be a lot more enjoyable than the previous. We found a register here, and stopped to eat lunch.\nNearing the summit of Duane Bliss Peak\nDuane Bliss Peak summit panorama\nAfter eating and reapplying our sunscreen, it was time to get back on the trail. That sunscreen must have ended up on my camera lens, because just about every picture I took after that has a bit of a sunscreen filter. There aren’t any trails on the mountain that I’m aware of, so we tried our best to cut directly down towards the TRT. This worked pretty well, and after a bit of light bushwhacking, we were on track.\nFrom here, it was only a few easy miles back to the truck. We managed to crank them out pretty quickly, and before I knew it, we were back at the trailhead. The guy in the van who had been sleeping when we left was now sitting in a chair reading a book. Kind of a strange place to camp (right by highway 50), but more power to him. We loaded up in the truck, and made the drive back to the Daggett Loop Trailhead. Jed and I said goodbye, and went our separate ways. I stopped in Gardnerville to get some supplies, and ended up heading back to Blue Lakes road for the night.\nWildflowers near the Spooner Summit Trailhead\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",
    "description": "July 5th, 2023 Chris returned home on the 5th, so it was down to just Jed and myself for the next leg of the journey. Jed was planning to head home after this one, and I was planning to stay out a few more nights. Wanting to get another double summit day, we decided on Genoa and Duane Bliss Peaks. They aren’t nearly as exciting as the other peaks we had done recently, but it would also allow us to knock out one of our last remaining sections of the TRT. Jed and I met at Spooner summit, and we got into his car to drive to the Daggett Trailhead.",

    "content": "July 4th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nFor our second stop on our peakbagging road trip, we camped on the side of Blue Lakes Road. Being the third of July, I was a bit pessimistic about finding a good place to camp, but we did end up finding a great place right by some running water. We woke up around 5 on the 4th and geared up for the day. We weren’t entirely sure about the snow, so we ended up bringing snowshoes just in case (we would later regret this decision).\nBlue Lakes Road was closed 7 miles in, and we got to the road closure right around 6am and set off. The walk up the road was pretty easy, we passed some snow removal equipment not far from the start, despite a completely snow free road. Not too long after, we decided it would make sense to cut off the road to the left and up a small drainage. From there, we figured it would be a fairly simple ridge walk to the base of Da-Ek Dow Go-Et mountain.\nThe decision paid off, after a relatively easy section of cross country, we crested the ridge and the mountain came into view. We continued along towards it, and picked up a nice double track trail shortly thereafter. The mountain looked quite imposing, but we had done our research and I wasn’t too worried about it. After a few small ups and downs, we arrived at the base.\nOur first objective comes into view\nFrom there, we wrapped around to the southeast, traversing over some steep and loose volcanic rock. It was a bit of a precarious walk, the base was firm with small loose rocks covering the top. We figured out where the typical route was pretty quickly, and scrambled up some easy class 3 to get to the bottom of it.\nDa-Ek Dow Go-Et was formerly named Jeff Davis Peak, which apparently was because of a group of Confederate sympathizers that were in the area in the 1800s. I don’t think mountains should be named after traitors, so I much prefer the Washoe name that has replaced it. It’s by far the most technical peak on the Ogul list, so I was glad to be getting it over with. It also is one of the more visually striking peaks on the list in my opinion.\nThe plan was for Jed to solo up first (he’s a far stronger climber than Chris or myself), he would then sling a big rock up there, and belay Chris and myself. Jed handled the first pitch with ease, staying cool as a cucumber up the somewhat sketchy (yet technically easy) volcanic rock. Chris and I were waiting a good distance back, acutely aware of the high rockfall danger on this route. Jed called out “safe” when he got the anchor set up, and tossed the rope down.\nThe first pitch we roped up for\nI climbed next, the climb wasn’t very hard, but slightly scary due to the quality of the rock. I topped out the pitch in a few minutes, and climbed up behind Jed and the big chockstone that was used for the anchor. This was inside of a small cave that went further up the mountain at a fairly steep angle. Once I was situated, Jed tossed the rope down for Chris, who climbed up next. There was still a piece of webbing backed up by some cord here left by another party, so Jed was able to set the anchor up on that, using the 96” sling we brought to make things extra redundant. The belay area was cramped, but I was able to get comfortable behind the chockstone.\nAt this point, it was looking like the route would have to go out over some pretty big exposure, which made me a bit apprehensive for Jed to solo it. My neck was hurting from sleeping on it wrong the night before, so I was trying not to move it around too much. Thankfully I looked up the cave at one point and realized that I could see daylight through it. Memories of the trip reports I had read came flooding back, and I realized that the route went through there. We were all relieved by this. Once Chris was up, we took down the anchor and started shimmying up the cave.\nJed belaying Chris up the first pitch\nOn top of the cave was a much flatter and larger belay station. The final pitch looked a lot more secure, a narrow chimney led up to the top. Jed tied into the rope, and I gave him a belay up. We weren’t sure what exactly the climb looked like above the chimney, so he planned to sling something part of the way up if needed. He got up the pitch easily again, and set up another anchor and tossed the rope down.\nI climbed second again, and found the pitch to be a lot easier and more secure than the previous. No real exposure, and the holds were pretty secure. Once I got up, I got out of the way and fought the temptation to run up to the summit before Chris made it. Chris was up shortly, and we all went the last 20-30 feet up together.\nChris coming up the chimney\nThe summit had great views of the surrounding areas, Raymond Peak and The Sinister looked particularly cool from this vantage. We probably spent a good 20 minutes on top enjoying the views and signing the register.\nSummit Panorama\nOn the way down, we opted to leave the 96” sling at the top for Jed to rap off of. He lowered Chris and myself off the first pitch before rapping down. We repeated the process down the bottom pitch, and soon were all at the base safely. We managed to all climb without falling or knocking anything down aside from a few small pebbles. In my opinion, 3 is a perfect number for this type of climb. I wouldn’t have wanted to do this with a much larger group due to the rockfall danger.\nAt the base we got our packs resituated, and retraced the ridge back to a large rock where we had stashed our snowshoes that morning. We wanted to stop for a snack break here, but saw some trees not far which would offer some shade. We made it down there, and enjoyed a nice break. A family with a dog walked by at one point, heading towards the ridge where we had come from.\nOur next stop was The Nipple, which was a short distance across the road. The Nipple was still holding a good patch of snow near the peak, and we debated how direct of a line we wanted to take. We had snowshoes, but no crampons, and the top patch of snow looked possibly a bit steep for what we had. We ended up opting to go for the direct route, and started heading down towards the road.\nAfter a short road walk, we cut back up towards the Nipple. We walked up a steep but mostly dry rib, seeing some nice ancient Junipers along the way. Just below the snowfield, we scrambled around a large rock outcropping. The snowfield looked steep, but manageable. There was a bit of risk if we slipped, but it didn’t look deadly. We kicked steps in our trail runners one by one, and managed the snow with ease.\nWeighing our route options going up The Nipple\nFrom there, it was a simple but steep walk up chossy volcanic rock to the summit. We saw a group of deer very close to the summit, who weren’t very happy to see us and moved on their way in the opposite direction. Before long, we were at the top signing the register.\nDeer near the summit\nThe view from here was good, but probably not as good as from Da-Ek Dow Go-Et. At this point, we had another choice to make. We could either retrace our steps, or head down northeast directly towards my truck. We again opted for the more direct route.\nSummit Panorama\nThe walk down was steep, but mostly easy. We had to cross another steep and exposed patch of snow, but made it across with no issues. The wildflowers on this side of the mountain were spectacular. We stopped one more time on the way down to reapply sunscreen, and before long dropped off the ridge down directly towards my truck. After battling some marshy ground, we were at the meadow, where we found a dirt road leading back towards the truck. We got back to the truck around 3:30 and returned to our campsite. A short day as far as mileage goes, but a fun and rewarding one for sure.\nHeading back down towards Blue Lakes Road\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

    "content": "July 2nd, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nSaturday morning (the 1st of July), I drove out to the Sweetwaters once again QA. This time, my friends Chris and Jed joined me as well. We had plans to move around to a few places and bag some peaks. They planned to stay until Wednesday and Thursday, and I planned to stay until Friday or Saturday. We made it out to our campsite near the creek that runs down Sweetwater Canyon. The creek was flowing pretty well, so they parked on the north side of the creek, and we loaded my truck up to cross the creek and get to the better campsite on the south side.\nWe woke up early Sunday morning, and loaded my truck up so we could take it as far as we could up the canyon. The road was mostly easy, but we did encounter one pretty challenging uphill section of rocks. I was able to slowly make my way up it, but probably wouldn’t want to do it again without some additional ground clearance on my truck. Before long, we were at the old cabin that the maps call the “Nugent Cabin”. We parked the truck here and got ready for the day’s hike.\nWe immediately needed to cross the creek, which was raging pretty hard up there. Thankfully Chris and Jed spotted a crossing while I was still getting the last few things ready. We made it across the slightly slippery log without incident, and started walking up the road towards the top of the canyon. The road soon turned much more narrow, and made switchbacks up the steep canyon wall. At one point it seemed to fizzle out, and we realized that it was just a singletrack footpath beyond this point.\nChris across the log crossing\nFrom here, we traversed above the canyon floor, crossing a smaller creek about ¾ of a mile past the switchbacks. The trail was unmaintained, but still pretty easy to follow. We came across what must have been a small settlement soon after that, with bits of metal scattered about. Just beyond that were the ruins of another cabin, this one was in far worse shape than the Nugent Cabin.\nLooking up to the top of the canyon\nWe slowly rounded the corner and were soon above the top section of the canyon, which was still mostly filled with snow at the bottom. We stayed high, and the trail became hard to follow, and then completely gone. From here we could see that we needed to get up a pretty steep scree field, which would put us pretty close to the summit. We all had different ideas of how to deal with the scree, Chris dropped to the canyon floor, and walked up as far as he could before going up. Jed cut at a roughly 45 degree angle, getting closer to the canyon mouth while still going up. I initially tried going straight up, but eventually ended up at an angle closer to Jeds.\nThe steep climb up to the ridge\nWe all topped out within a few minutes of each other, none of the routes was very fun. Very much a 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. I checked my CalTopo app and was delighted to see that we were at 10,900 feet. That meant we had roughly 800 vertical feet left to get to the summit, and nothing would be as steep for the rest of the day.\nChris emerging from scree hell\nFrom there we walked southwest until we came across a trail that led towards the summit. We stopped at a snow patch and put some snow into our hats to cool off. There was no shade up there, but the slight wind made the temperatures bearable. The trail was a pleasant walk, and it eventually linked up with a much larger road that cut straight up to the summit in a pretty steep fashion.\nWe got onto the road, and stopped to read the “Mars with Flowers” sign before it started its steep final push up Mt Patterson. It was relatively easy going from there to the summit. Just a steep road through the moonscape. We were all a bit out of breath, but moving pretty well. Before we knew it, we were on top of the Sweetwater range.\nSign below the summit\nWe hung out for perhaps 20 minutes on the summit. Enjoying the views, and finding a weird assortment of items in the register box. Unfortunately this assortment didn’t include a register to sign. We did however find a properly folded American Flag, some bourbon, someone’s ORV registration, and some other odds and ends. I left my mark by putting a Lover’s Leap Guides sticker on the flagpole.\nPatterson Summit panorama\nAfter our rest on the summit of Patterson, we continued along towards Wheeler, the second objective of the day. There seemed to be a road that went most of the way to Wheeler, just topping shy of the summit. We lumbered along downhill, crossing another fairly significant patch of snow. The road to Wheeler from there went up and down, but generally was fairly flat. After perhaps 20 or 30 minutes, we cut off from the road towards the summit of Wheeler. There were 2 peaks that could have been the summit. One was darker, and a bit closer, the other was lighter in color. We topped out on the darker one, only to realize that the other one was the summit. We hustled over to the lighter colored peak, and found the register and proper summit we had been looking for.\nColorful rock on the way to Wheeler\nI thought the views from Wheeler were perhaps a bit better than from Patterson. From here we could see the large network of roads cut into the side of Patterson, and a lot more of the moonscape. It’s a bit sad to see such a unique area torn up by mining, but it’s also very interesting to see. We again hung out for 20 minutes or so, taking some time to eat lunch. After that, we decided it was time to head back, and began retracing the route to Patterson.\nSummit panorama\nThe walk back was pretty easy, we made it back near the summit of Patterson, but didn’t go all the way back to the summit. We went back past the “Mars with Flowers” sign. We almost took the road a bit too far past the trail here, but we caught it and doubled back pretty quickly. We once again stopped at the patch of snow to fill our hats, and headed towards the steep scree field we had come up that morning. From here. It looked a lot steeper than when we had climbed it. Easily 45 degrees or steeper. Chris and I made a b-line straight down it, scree skiing side by side. We made it down in less than 5 minutes. Jed angled a bit down the canyon, before doing the same as Chris and I. We all reconvened at the snow, and opted to walk down the snow for as long as it seemed safe to do so. A few times we tried climbing out of the snow, but decided it was easier to just glissade down the snow.\nWalking back towards Patterson\nBack in the Canyon, still a hefty snowpack for July\nNear the end of the good snow (free of sketchy looking snow bridges), Chris spotted a piece of machinery on the south side of the canyon. We made our way over to it, and found that it was some old mining machinery, probably an air compressor or water pump. There was a mine shaft right next to it, mostly filled with water. We spent a few minutes checking it all out and snapping some pics before moving on.\nThe old mining equipment we found\nAvalanche Debris lower in the canyon\nAfter the snow coverage got a bit thinner, we climbed back up the north side of the canyon, and reconvened with the trail. The walk back from there was pretty easy and pleasant. We stopped at one of the creeks we had crossed, and wet our hats and filled back up on water. We got back to the switchbacks, and back to the old doubletrack road. The last obstacle was the log crossing, and while the water was a good bit higher, we made it across safely. We loaded back up into my truck, and went back down the road. Once we had safely navigated all of the rocks, I was finally able to let my guard down. We spent one more night at the campsite before moving north the next day.\nBack on Doubletrack\nRoute GPX Track Download",

I’ve been trying to knock out some of the furthest ones so I can eventually just have ones near Tahoe left, plus a lot of options are still unavailable to me after the insane winter we had. I wanted to go for a quick overnight camping trip with my wife and my dog, and Adams seemed to check all of the prerequisite boxes, so I took off work a few hours early Friday, and we started the drive up.\nWe drove up through Reno, and stopped at the In N Out Burger there for dinner. We got George a pup patty (a plain unsalted patty), and made sure to give it to him in small pieces so that he’d actually savor it and not just demolish it in 3 seconds. All 3 of us enjoyed the meal, and continued up north on 395, a stretch of road I’ve never been on. We drove for another half hour or so, and stopped at the Red Rocks trailhead, where I had read there were some dispersed camping areas. We found a decent spot to camp, and took the short walk up to the Red Rocks themselves. After spending a bit enjoying the cool formations, we walked back down to the truck, and decided to move it up the road a bit closer to camp for the night.\nGeorge and the Red Rocks\nRed Rocks\nOur Campsite\nI let myself sleep in Saturday, but we were both up and moving by 6AM or so. We broke camp, and made breakfast burritos to fuel our easy hike. George discovered that they had sticks up there, and occupied himself chewing on and burying them, we even threw a couple for him which is his favorite thing in the world. Once we were packed up, we got in the truck and started driving to Frenchman Lake. The lake looked nice and full, we drove towards its east side, and onto a network of dirt roads.\nI had gotten some GPX files of the drive from Peakpagger, which made the drive pretty easy to navigate. We did have to overcome a few very deep rutted muddy sections, but were able to get around them without too much issue. Near the start of our hike, we encountered a large tree down in the road, which I managed to also get around with just a few inches to spare. On the way back, the tree had been miraculously cleared from the road by somebody, prompt service in the Plumas National Forest!\nWe arrived at the trailhead, geared up and started the hike. After 3 or 4 minutes, I checked my caltopo app only to realize we were heading down a dirt road that didn’t go anywhere near the peak. We turned around, and made it back to the truck to find the proper dirt road to follow. The dirt road we walked was barely a road, more of a glorified dirt bike trail perhaps, it had teenaged trees growing right in the middle of it. Clearly nobody had driven this thing in over a decade in a full sized vehicle.\nLooking up towards Mt Adams near the start\nThe entire area was burned quite severely in the 2021 Beckwourth Complex Fire. It seems like in most areas basically all of the trees died. It’s quite sad to see, but it is cool to come back a few years later and see how quickly other plants fill the void. The wildflowers were extremely abundant, as well as the mushrooms. We crossed over a small creek, which was right around where the “road” fizzled out. George got in the creek and splashed around for a bit, and we continued on, heading to the east of the small peaklet (about 7600’) north of Adams. The terrain got pretty steep here, and despite the hike being short, it was a bit tedious walking along the side of the hill here.\nOne of the many types of wildflowers we saw\nBefore long, we crossed another, smaller creek separating Adams and its northern neighbor. George tested the waters again, and we decided to continue hugging the east side of Adams as it looked marginally less steep. The dead trees eventually gave way to more granite, and the summit became more and more apparent the closer we got. Around this time, George seemed to get a bit tired, and started pulling more across the hill than straight up it. I encouraged him along the last little bit, and we topped out together right around 10:15 AM.\nGeorge in the second creek\nSummit Panorama\nLooking to the east, it seemed that the subpeak in that direction might be slightly higher. I had done very little research, but knew that, according to the forest service topo map I had loaded, this was the peak. The USGS marker and nifty aluminum summit register seemed to confirm this. When I returned home, I learned that the east summit may indeed be a few feet higher. The Ogul list seems to indicate that the west summit is what counts for the list, but I’ll still likely come back and ski it just because it bothers me to not stand at the “true” summit. It sounds like the peak was declared incorrectly at some point, and those USGS markers aren’t easy to move.\nSummit Marker\nThe register dated back to 1972, and seemed to be made of cast aluminum. I had never seen this design before but it seemed to be quite sturdy and weather resistant. We both signed the register, and took some pictures. We had nowhere important to be, so we spent a good 20 minutes on top enjoying some snacks and the views. Lassen was visible to the north, as well as Honey Lake. I couldn’t really determine what many of the other visible peaks were from the unfamiliar area, but Caltop’s viewshed layer told me that the tops of some other Oguls (Mt Rose and Siegel) were visible to the south.\nMe and George on top, the summit register is in my hand\nOn the way down, we took the west side of the peak because it looked a bit more mellow, and to spice up the scenery. At first it was a bit of a bushwack through some charred, but still quite strong bushes. After that, it was just like the way up. Dead trees and low shrubs with lots of wildflowers mixed in. I have read that this was a bushwhack before the fire, and I would imagine it will be again in just a few years. With the huge winter we got, it really felt like this was a special June to be on this peak. It felt like we were there right at the peak wildflower bloom.\nBurned trees and bushes on the way down\nWe traversed a bit closer to the peaklet on the way out, and made our way back down to the first creek in good time. What seemed like the remnants of a steep road led us straight down the canyon into a short section that was quite boggy. We both managed to get our feet wet, and George ran off to the creek to get his whole body wet. A few hundred yards downstream we were able to pick up the “road”, and followed that back down to the proper road, this time we seemed to go in a slightly different direction. I think there are probably a lot of things that seem like roads out there that may or may not actually be one. We got back to the truck around 11:45 AM and made the long drive back down along the dirt road.\nMore wildflowers\nGeorge leading the way back\nSome of us enjoyed the creek more than others\nWe stopped in Sierraville for some Mexican food on the way home, unfortunately they don’t have a dog menu, but George was fast asleep in the back seat. Instead of taking 395 through Reno, we opted for highway 89 back to Truckee, which neither of us had ever driven before. The drive was quite pleasant, everything was still very green. In Truckee, we made one last stop at the Donner Memorial State Park, we had a Poppy Pass and figured it was worth checking out for a few minutes. The drive home from there was uneventful, and we made it back with plenty of daylight to spare. Not bad for an impromptu Friday night camping trip.\nThe lupines were in full force on the drive out\nRoute Something weird happened with my Caltopo App and it went a bit crazy at the start, creating some erratic lines GPX Track Download",

    "content": "June 3rd, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy alarm went off at an ungodly 2AM on this fine Saturday morning. I had 2 parties to go to later that day, the first being at noon. I stubbornly refused to give up on bagging another Ogul this weekend, and Mt Rose seemed to make the most sense given a lot of factors (mostly snow and estimated time to the summit). I rolled out of bed, and made the long sleepy drive up to Mt Rose Summit via highway 80. I’m a big proponent of the alpine start, but what sucks about driving at 2AM is that you can’t see any of the scenery. Regardless, I made it to the trailhead and was walking by 4:48AM. I didn’t have a ton of info on the route, but understood there was a bridge somewhere over Galena Creek, and that I’d just need to aim for the east ridge. Easy stuff on paper.\nA hundred feet or so from leaving the truck, I stumbled upon a BBQ, chairs and a cooler, and not long after, a person sleeping in a hammock. I have no idea if I woke them up or not, but I tried my best not to. From there, I cut down towards the creek to see if I could find the bridge. I never did find it, and ended up bushwhacking my way upstream through thickets of young aspen and soft snow, not terribly fun. I was on the lookout for either the bridge, or a way to get across. Eventually I found a somewhat sketchy but solid looking log to cross. It was a downed aspen, quite wet in places, and had a tangle of branches just strong enough to push me around. I did my best to use the branches to plant my poles on for balance, and survived the crossing without falling in. After that I made my way up the hill a bit, and eventually stumbled upon a faint trail. I followed the trail for a bit, eventually getting to the point where I could see the south facing side of the ridge. It was mostly dried out, and I decided I would ditch my splitboard here. I had brought it as more of a tool than a recreational device, and it appeared I had a good chance to just make it in my trail runners.\nMy sketchy but effective log crossing\nAnother beautiful sierra sunrise\nAfter finding a suitable tree to stash some gear behind, I cut up towards the ridge. Feeling a lot lighter, I started making pretty decent time. I found another use trail and followed that along the side of the ridge, before running into a steep snowfield filling in a small gully. I tested a step on it. and immediately knew that wasn’t going to work well in shoes. I ended up going directly up the steep ridge here, skirting the edge of the ridge. The area where the snowpatch had retreated recently was still held together nicely by moisture. I finally topped out and was on the ridge to find it still had significant snow coverage. There was a thin strip near the edge where I was able to bushwhack a path for a bit without needing to go into the snow.\nLooking down towards my parking spot after gaining the ridge\nI worked my way up, switching between bushwhacking and gingerly walking in the snow with minimal traction, neither option was ideal. After what felt like a while, the ridge came to a rocky high point, which I skirted to the left the best I could, trying to avoid snow. From here I could see the summit, and enjoyed a nice long stretch of snow free travel, even joining up with the summer trail for a bit.\nLight bushwhacking at the edge of the snow\nI had a choice ahead of me: take one last, somewhat steep snowfield to get to the summit ridge, or go to the left and do some class 3 or 4 climbing to avoid it. I decided I’d give the snow a try, and traverse over to the rocks if needed. The snow had sun cups about 6 inches deep, which provided the perfect place to put my feet. It never really got that hard, even in the steeper couple hundred feet towards the top.\nThe summit block\nMidway up the last snowfield\nFrom atop the snowfield. 2 bumps in the ridge lay ahead, the second being the proper summit. I veered left around the first ridge, but ended up going to the top of it anyway because it ended up looking easier to go that way. At that point, I was a few hundred feet from the summit, and made it over there quickly. My goal had been to make it to the top by 8AM, and back to the truck by 10AM. I stood on the summit right at 7:57. The view of Tahoe was beautiful, and I could see quite a few of my most recent peaks I’d climbed, including Mt Siegel from just 5 days earlier. I didn’t find a register, but did see some interesting artifacts of some sort of structure that was there at one point. After taking a few pictures, and a bit of a snack break, I headed back down.\nSummit panorama\nA decent view of Tahoe\nI made great time getting back to the snowfield, going the other way around the bump in the ridge before the summit just to get a fresher view of the area. The snowfield was a fun glissade/butt slide, and I was down it in short order. I power walked the dry patch between that and the next long snowfield, I had a lot of driving and 2 parties to make it to, so I had no time to waste. The long snowfield was a blast to glissade down, my feet got soaked, but I was sliding on and off for a solid mile.\nThe long glissade back down\nAt one point, I saw a black furry creature charging up the ridge towards me. For a moment, I thought it was a bear cub and that things might get a bit sketchy. Thankfully, it was a friendly dog that ran right up with its tail wagging, wanting some attention from me. Not far below was the owner making his way up on snowshoes. I altered my course a bit to stop and talk to the owner. I figured we could swap info on the route. He ended up being grumpy and not wanting to talk aside from some one word responses and grunts. In retrospect, he was probably jealous to see such a strapping young lad already on his way down at such an early hour. With no time to waste on the old grouch, I continued sliding my way down the ridge, having a great time, barely in control at times.\nMore snow to descend\nOnce I got near the bottom of the ridge, I started checking my CalTopo app to see where I’d need to cut down to fetch my gear. I took a slightly different path, but found the use trail eventually and was soon at my gear, which was just as I’d left it. I quickly loaded up the heavy burden that I didn’t need to bring, and begrudgingly carried on. The skis were at an awkward angle, making my poles bump into the bottoms. I got back onto the use trail, and enjoyed my last bit of easy walking before the bushwhack ahead.\nMy gear right where I left it\nI found the bushwhack to be more aggravating being fully awake, and with softer snow. I was punching through a lot more, but trying my best to still make good time. My 10AM deadline was looking tighter by the moment. I found the log crossing, and once again made the sketchy walk across the slippery Aspen. After crossing, I had about a quarter mile of thick Aspen and soft snow. Thankfully I had the advantage of daylight this time, so I was able to at least see ahead a bit. After some thrashing about, I started hearing music in the distance and figured it must be someone on the highway. As I got closer, I recognized the song as “The Spins” by Mac Miller, one of my favorites from senior year of high school. The music ended up being the people camped out, who were now fully awake and enjoying the day. I waved as I passed by their camp, and was at the truck right at 9:56AM with wet feet, but otherwise feeling great.\nRoute GPX Track Download",
    "description": "June 3rd, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy alarm went off at an ungodly 2AM on this fine Saturday morning. I had 2 parties to go to later that day, the first being at noon. I stubbornly refused to give up on bagging another Ogul this weekend, and Mt Rose seemed to make the most sense given a lot of factors (mostly snow and estimated time to the summit). I rolled out of bed, and made the long sleepy drive up to Mt Rose Summit via highway 80. I’m a big proponent of the alpine start, but what sucks about driving at 2AM is that you can’t see any of the scenery. Regardless, I made it to the trailhead and was walking by 4:48AM. I didn’t have a ton of info on the route, but understood there was a bridge somewhere over Galena Creek, and that I’d just need to aim for the east ridge. Easy stuff on paper.",

    "content": "May 29th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI woke up at my campsite near Sonora Pass right around 4:40AM. It was 20 minutes before my alarm, but the desert birds had started their morning routine already. This was my third morning out there, and I knew that this meant the sun was coming up soon. I felt rested so I forced myself out of my down quilt, and started packing my truck up. I quickly broke camp and threw everything in my truck, on the road towards Gardnerville shortly after 5. The drive went by quickly, and I went straight to the Walmart there to grab some food for my excursion.\nAfter leaving Walmart, I headed down Lone Pine Canyon Road, figuring I’d go as far as I felt comfortable going with my truck. There are various reports on this road on peakbagger.com, with varying accounts of how difficult the road is. One person suggested airing down your tires a few miles in (not really an option without a compressor), and others claimed to have made it to the Galena Saddle, just shy of the peak in stock 4runners and Tacomas. The road was just a normal dirt road for the first few miles. but around the area where the person suggested airing down it had a ton of rocks on the road. I understood why he suggested that, but wasn’t too worried about my tires yet. I made one fairly deep creek crossing, and encountered some pretty deep mud and ruts along the next few miles. At one point, I bottomed my truck out on a big rock, which made me wince pretty hard. I got out and checked the underside of my truck, and nothing seemed damaged, so I kept going. Eventually the mud got more consistent, as well as the deep ruts that required you to straddle to avoid getting stuck. I told myself I’d use the next good pullout to park and just walk from there. The road not long after I parked\nI found a good place to park, and got my stuff ready to go. My plan was to hit this fast and light, I wanted to get done early so I could make it down Highway 50 before too much Memorial Day traffic formed near Meyers as it often does. The parking spot was somewhere around 1.5 miles from the start of the ridge that leads up to Mt Siegel that I planned to take up. This section of road was easy enough to walk, but I was glad to have left my truck behind. There were a few spots where I had to jump across sections of water in the road, and for a few hundred feet the road became more of a creek. Near the ridge, some very deep ruts had formed that I would definitely not have wanted to attempt in my truck.\nMt Siegel’s Ridge\nBefore too long, I started cutting up from the road to the ridge, immediately soaking my feet in the dew-covered tall grass. There was a pretty significant fire here a few years back, so there was a mix of dead trees and a fairly vibrant selection of shrubs, grasses and flowers. A part of me is always bummed to see an area burned so badly, but its also reassuring to see how quickly things restore. Fire is after all just part of the cycle in places like this. I’m sure this was neither the first nor last fire in this area. Wet grass on the bottom of the ridge\nAfter a light bushwhack, I started up the beginning of the ridge proper. This was one of the steepest sections of the ridge all day, mostly medium sized light colored granite with tree carcasses and shrubs among it. The climb would consist of many sections of steeper ridge leading to brief sections where it flattened out. I put my focus on making it up the first such section and was there before too long. The view from up there was pretty nice towards Job’s Peak from the previous weekend. Job’s Peak in the distance\nFrom here, the angle was a bit lighter for a good distance before the next high point on the ridge, and the ratio of vegetation to rock started to lean more in favor of rock. I kept moving pretty consistently here, stopping occasionally to snap a picture and catch my breath. The weather was overcast which I was grateful for, this peak must be brutal in the heat of summer with direct sunlight. Looking back I could clearly see where the fire had stopped, creating a stark contrast between the green forest and the recovering shrubs. My route followed the ridge up to point 8595, and I stopped again for a quick snack break and to check my progress on the map. Looking up from near point 8595\nMaking it to the next bump in the ridge looked like it would require crossing at least a small section of snow, so I tried to aim for the shortest possible crossing. The climb up to this point started to feel a lot more alpine. The chunks of granite became generally a lot larger and the slope was steeper. That said, I found the larger pieces of granite to be more stable and easier to hop across, this is one of my favorite types of terrain to travel through. I managed to find about the shortest section of snow possible to cross, and was soon on point 9354, just a few hundred vertical feet below Siegel, but with a decent distance left.\nSome interesting bones, perhaps a cougar or a beaver?\nThe rest of the journey from here didn’t look too bad, I’d lose a trivial amount of elevation, cross a fairly large saddle, and then make the final push to the summit. I set off, making great time on some of the easier terrain of the day. A few times, I stopped when I noticed cool looking bones on the ground. I’ve seen my fair share of bones, but never so many so close to each other as Mt Siegel. The summit was now fully socked in with fog, giving it a pretty cool look. It didn’t really feel like I was in Nevada at this point with the way things looked.\nThe last stretch towards the summit\nBefore long, I was at the last climb up towards the summit, and made it up quickly. I realized that I was closing in on 3 hours since I had started, and this arbitrary time limit made me move more quickly. There is a pile of rocks just north of the true summit that I felt might be higher, so I went up that just to be sure, before heading over to the large summit cairn. I summited at 10:13AM, about 2 hours and 52 minutes after leaving the truck. I snapped some pictures, signed the register, and transferred some gatorade into the bottle that I carry on my shoulder strap for the way down. After a few minutes of snacking and enjoying the view, I began my descent.\nSummit panorama\nThe descent proved to be pretty quick and easy by comparison. I opted to go east around point 9354, although I ended up having to cross a larger snowfield so that may not have been all that much more efficient. Once I cleared the larger granite, I was able to veer more to the east and pick up the pace significantly through more sandy soil, even jogging for sections where I could. I passed point 8595 in the same fashion, and made a great time down to the last point before the road. From here, I was forced to slow down a bit as there was a ton of downed trees and thicker brush. I started hearing engines down below me, and saw a truck emerging from the woods near where I had cut up to the ridge. The truck did not seem to be making much progress, so I went directly towards it just in case they were stuck and might need help.\nI enjoyed a bit of glissading on the way down\nLooking back down the ridge, the line of the fire is stark\nI got down to the road and found that it was actually a group of 4 or 5 off roaders, slowly making their way through some very deep ruts and mud. We talked for a minute or 2, and I gave them what info I could about what lay ahead for them. They too were heading up Mt Siegel, although they intended to drive to the top. The rest of the road was fairly uneventful from there. The sun came out a bit more than before, although I never really felt hot. As I got closer, the 5 hour round trip marker started to creep up, and I again had an arbitrary time to beat. I hustled down the road and made it to the truck right at 4 hours 53 minutes.\nWashed out road on the way back to the truck\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "May 28th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI let myself sleep in until around 6 after doing East and Middle Sisters the day before. I figured Desert Creek Peak would be a relatively easy day in comparison. I packed all of my stuff into my truck, and drove down to where I had seen Desert Creek the day before. There ended up being some people camped here, so I decided I’d find some other place to park my truck. I had seen a side spur road about a mile south on my topo map, so decided to check that out. This road was near the base of Black Mountain, and I figured I could link the ridges between the 2 up. I had read a Bob Burd trip report about him doing both, but my memories were pretty fuzzy about the details. I didn’t have any service so I figured I’d just use my topo maps and wing it. I made it a decent ways up the spur road, and found a nice place to park my truck for the day. This was well off the beaten path, so I was pretty confident nobody would mess with my stuff. I loaded my day pack up, and was off shortly on my way.\nThere was no trail, but the route was fairly obvious. I aimed between 2 small bumps below Black Mountain, and hung a left(heading north) once I got between them. Up until this point, I was just walking through nice evenly spaced Pinyon Pines with the occasional bit of Sage here or there. After hanging the left, I was faced with a big thicket of Mountain Mahogany, which had been the hardest part of the day before coming down East Sister.I made my way through this, aiming for the ridge of Black Mountain ahead. After the thicket, I went downhill a short way to a fairly clear opening that led up the the slope of the mountain.\nSome Lupine early into the walk\nI made my way up northwest, on something that felt somewhat like a ridge, but with a decent amount of trees obscuring most of the views. The bushwhacking wasn’t terrible for the most part, mostly Pinyon Pines which seem to dominate the area they grow in, and are relatively easy to walk through. Once I made it to the proper ridge leading to the summit, things got worse. I had to crawl through some sections of really thick brush on my hands and knees. Before long though, I had found the somewhat ambiguous summit, marked by a small pile of rocks. I was a bit disappointed (but not surprised) that there was no register here. I looked through the pile of rocks to no avail. After snapping some pictures and soaking in the (actually decent) view, I continued along the ridge to the northeast.\nBushwhacking conditions near the top of Black Mountain\nThe pile of rocks marking the summit\nBlack Mountain Summit panorama\nThe ridge was more of a bushwhack, but I didn’t find it to be that bad. Sticking either on the ridge, or just slightly on the leeward side seemed to be the play here. The rocks made somewhat of a path that was manageable, below the ridge on either side looked quite a bit harder. I passed a few cool volcanic features with some easy 3rd class scrambling near the bottom of the ridge. Eventually the ridge opened up into a nice open area of low sage that was about a quarter mile long. It was a nice break from the bushwhacking, but I could see more coming not far ahead. I was soon back in the thicket going uphill for another 300 vertical feet or so before coming to another opening, now facing directly towards the ridge leading to Desert Creek Peak, the true prize of the day. I stopped here and ate some of my sandwich and compared my topo maps to what I could see with my eyes. It seemed that the easiest path forward would be to drop down a few hundred feet to the northeast, and then try to link up a somewhat continuous line of less dense vegetation.\nDesert Creek Peak to the north\nThe rocky ridge coming down Black Mountain\nThe clearing where I stopped for a break\nI decided to go with my plan, and dropped down through more low Sage. I was soon on what was clearly a game trail, I saw a ton of deer droppings along this for a good distance, before veering back uphill to the northwest. I had spotted a pretty distinct rock about half way up the mountain from the field of sage that I was able to use to orient myself on the lower part of the slope. Eventually though, I was in the thick of things again nearing the top of the ridge and just had to rely on a general sense of direction and the path of least resistance. As with the ridge before, I once again found there to be some relatively easy travel just below the ridge on the leeward side. I continued forcing my will upon the thick brush before finally making it to the ridge proper where I found a decent path among the rocks.\nThe view from midway up the bushwhack to the ridge\nLooking south towards the Sisters from the ridge\nAt this point I was getting pretty close to the summit, although there was one last bump on the ridge to overcome. I came across a fairly long patch of snow that I was happy to find still firm enough to support my weight, and happily walked across it. Even short sections of open walking made me quite happy that day compared to the effort that some other sections required to just make it the next few feet. I came to the top of the last bump, and could see the the communication tower on the summit not far in the distance. I knew that the regular route came through this area, and tried my best to find it on the west side of the ridge. As I later learned reading some trip reports, there isn’t really an actual trail, more of just a path of least resistance up the thing. The last bit of the way up to the summit stuck to the days theme, and was a fight against Mountain Mahogany to the bitter end.\nI found a surprising amount of infrastructure at the summit, including a concrete footing that seemed to never get used, a large electrical enclosure (dated 1960), the communication tower, and various other odds and ends. I’m not entirely sure what the tower is for, but there is a California Department of Transportation marker at the summit, perhaps its used by CalTrans for radio communications? There are 2 thick black cords of some sort leading from the tower. They seemed easily thick enough to easily carry enough current to kill me, and the outer sheath was clearly compromised in quite a few places, so I stayed away from them. There was a large cairn on the summit, but unfortunately no register to be found. I hung out at the top for 15-20 minutes eating more of my sandwich and trying to formulate a plan for the way down.\nDesert Creek Peak summit panorama\nThe summit cairn\nCommunication tower at the summit, I’m not convinced it’s still operational\nI was faced with 2 options: take the normal route down, and have to deal with crossing the raging Desert Creek on the road multiple times, or try to bushwhack the ridge back a bit and then cut down south of the crossings, and take the road from there. I chose to take the ridge back as it seemed like a more novel route than most of the trip reports I had read, and that seemed to be a theme that day. Staying higher on the ridge than when I came up ended up working out quit well, there was a lot more rock up there to prevent brush from growing. I still had some hard sections, and had to army crawl through Mountain mahogany more than once, but it worked out pretty well and I was able to move a lot faster than my ascent. I played a Leon Bridges album from my phone speaker to get me through the bushwhack, which really lifted my spirits.\nLooking back up towards the summit\nWhat most of the ridge looked like\nI moved up and down the ridge until I got to the high point at around 8500 feet. From here, I started to make my way down to the southwest among some nicely spaced Pinion Pines. This was quite steep and loose, but open enough for me to do a light jog down a lot of it. This section flew by, and before long I was near what looked like a road on my topo map. I met up with the “road” near the bottom of the canyon, and found it to really be more of a ridiculously steep trail, I’m really not sure what type of vehicle could make it up. Right before the road, I found an area with a bunch of Obsidian flakes. I’m not sure if these were naturally occurring, or a relic from Native Americans, but they were cool to see either way.\nThings opening up down lower\nOne of many obsidian flakes I saw in a small area\nEnjoying a nice rest at Desert Creek\nWalking back up the road\nAt the bottom of the steep trail, I popped out onto the road, right across from where a group of people were camped. 3 dogs came charging at me, but their owner called them back, and they didn’t seem too aggressive. The owner apologized, and I continued down the road. Not far up from there was the spot I had planned to park at originally, which was now vacant. I stopped here for another 10-15 minutes and ate the rest of my lunch after dipping my feet in the water. From here it was another 1.5 miles or so back up the road, which was quite pleasant compared to what I had just been through. My truck was waiting for me just as I had left it on the lonely little side road. I was running low on clean water, and decided to pack up and head into Bridgeport to get more. This would put me a bit closer to my next day’s objective depending on where I camped. I ended up finding a nice spot right near the Sonora Pass junction, and enjoyed a nice early bedtime that night.\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "May 27th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI took off work a few hours early at 3PM Friday, and already had mostly loaded my truck up for 3 days of camping. I had a few odds and ends to handle after, but was on the road by 3:30PM or so. I stopped to get gas and a few road snacks in Placerville, and was soon headed up highway 50. Somewhere shortly before Kyburz, it started to rain pretty hard. I stopped at the Silverfork store and moved a few things from my truck bed that weren’t waterproof into the cab. I made a quick stop in Gardnerville for some Jack in the Box Tacos, and then headed down 395.\nShortly before Topaz Lake, I took a left onto highway 208 for the first time, having continued south every other time I’ve driven by. The rain was still coming down here, but not nearly as hard, it was more of a sprinkle. Before I knew it, 208 turned into 338 and I was heading south. Highway 338 reminded me a lot of 395 to the west, just with slightly different scenery. The mountains of Nevada were drying out, but most were still capped with some snow. Not long after I made it to Risue Road, which led to my campsite. Risue Road is pretty nice for a dirt forest service road, but there were a few mud crossings in the first half mile or so that I wouldn’t have wanted to try in a passenger car.\nI followed Risue road for a few miles, and soon opened my CalTopo app to get an idea of where the side road I wanted to take was. I turned onto the side road, and was greeted with some pretty thick brush on either side of the road that added some nice pinstripes to my truck. It kind of makes me cringe, but I didn’t get my truck to look pretty. The road didn’t go on for too long, and I was at the corral I had read about online soon. I had thought based on maps that there was perhaps a possibility of going further than the corral, but the road was completely overgrown and perhaps only 3 feet wide beyond there. I parked my truck and set up my tent in a light rain, and took a few minutes to walk around the area to check it out. It had a very cool rustic feel to it. I stayed up long enough to see the sun start to set, and was in bed before 9PM.\nSunset by the Corral\nSunrise by the Corral\nI got up the next morning around 5, and had my stuff packed for the day and was ready to go by 5:45. The sunrise over the valley was pretty spectacular. I set off up the road, and it opened up more after a few hundred feet. Not that it would have mattered, the ruts were deeper than I’d want to risk in my stock Frontier. I walked perhaps a half mile up the road before deciding to cut straight up to the ridge. This was fairly steep, but not too difficult.\nThe brief section of road I walked\nThe start of the ridge\nLooking back towards my campsite\nAfter 20 minutes or so, I made it to the first bench on the ridge where I could see the mountain above me better. It seemed like I could see the summit, and that it wasn’t all that far away. I was wrong, the ridge ended up having quite a few false summits. I made it to the the top of this one around 7:30, sticking to the west side to stay out of the snow. I was greeted with a higher point I’d need to go around or over that still wasn’t the summit.\nThe view up towards the false summit\nSome wildflowers I saw around 9000 feet on the ridge\nI opted to go around it the best it could staying to the west to avoid a large snowfield. From there, the ridge veered to the east, but I could see that it just dropped back down and continued along towards the true summit. I decided to try to maintain my current elevation and stick to the west side. This involved a bit of scrambling, and some loose talus in places, but seemed to save me some effort in the long run. On the still shady west side, the rain from the previous night seemed to have frozen, which made the granite slick, and definitely slowed me down a bit. Thankfully my patience paid off, and I didn’t end up slipping and getting injured.\nI soon came to the final section of the ridge up to the true summit, and had to make a choice about how to get around the snowfield with minimal contact with it. I had my ice axe and crampons with me just in case, but didn’t feel like using them. I managed to find the thinnest section of the snowfield, and carefully crossed it to the west. Much care was needed here, I had to gingerly kick each step, sometimes using my poles to help carve out a place for my foot. The snow was still surprisingly firm over here as the sun had not yet hit a lot of it. There was a dry patch followed by one more finger of snow to cross. After those, I was a short distance from the summit.\nLooking towards the actual summit\nThe patch of snow I had to cross\nThe last finger of snow blocking my progress\nThe rest of the climb from here was easy, just hopping up medium sized granite, and soon I was on top of East Sister. The view was pretty nice, and I made the first entry in the register since June of 2022. Apparently this isn’t a very popular mountain. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes enjoying the view and a small snack before continuing along the ridge towards Middle Sister. I had read that it was a bushwhack on the side I was coming down, but bushwhacks are always easier downhill, so I was glad to have that on my side. I spent a minute or 2 where the rock met the bushes, and decided on a path down.\nSummit Panorama\nLooking towards my next objective, Middle Sister\nThe bushwhack down East Sister\nI ended up veering more to the west, finding the best path I could through the thick mountain mahogany. This wasn’t terrible, but wasn’t very glamorous either. The best sections were perhaps 50 feet of clear walking, only to be back at the edge of a thicket, trying to decide the best path forward. Eventually though, I was through it and at the low point between the 2 peaks. Looking back up, there would be more patches of snow to avoid.\nLooking back up the bushwhack I had just come down\nI once again stuck to the west side, and was able to see a set of tracks(most likely a coyote or small mountain lion) heading up in about the same direction as me. I picked up the tracks several times over perhaps a quarter mile, eventually seeing them lead off to the east. Soon I came to another high point in the ridge, accompanied by another snow patch I’d have to circumvent. This one had a big weakness in it that I could easily spot. I worked my way up the west side of the ridge, staying a bit lower than the top of it. Just shy of one of the last bumps before the summit, I veered further west to get through the narrowest section of snow. I only ended up needing to take a few steps through snow to avoid this one.\nTracks in the snow\nAt this point I was about 4 or 5 hundred vertical feet from the summit, and just started going straight up as quickly as I could. Some ominous dark clouds were rolling in from the west, making me a tiny bit worried about thunderstorms. The forecast had looked clear the day before, but I’ve spent enough time on ridges above 10,000 feet to not put much faith in forecasts. With a bit more rock hopping, I was on the summit ridge, and on the summit of Middle Sister in short order. The last push up to the summit\nI stopped at the top to snap some pictures, and let my wife know I had made it. I was feeling on top of the world, until I opened the register and found a very strange and creepy photo. The photo was of a very dirty bathroom with torn up and stained wallpaper. The bathtub was full of some off white liquid, and a man was in it. Next to the bathtub was an older looking lady. Both of them were staring ominously at the camera, and there was a rope on the ground next to the tub. This seriously creeped me out, and took a minute or 2 to shake the feeling. I signed the register, and put the photo back face down in the box. I also found a small tree spider in the register that was somehow still alive. I let the spider out and tried to think about other things.\nMiddle Sister summit Panorama\nSouth Sister\nStrange photo from the register\nAfter doing my best to clear my mind of the weird ass photo, I relaxed and enjoyed my roast beef sandwich and some chips. I probably hung out for 20-30 minutes before deciding it was time to head down. I took the same route more or less down to the low point between Middle and East Sisters. From here, I decided to drop down west to the dirt road down in the valley. I didn’t want to repeat the bushwhack up East Sister, and the valley looked like a nice place to walk back. I dropped down off the ridge here, heading southwest. Looking down to the valley with the road\nI had scoped out the route with the least bushwhacking down there, and did pretty well. The worst of the brush I had to go through was just low sage n o higher than my knees. I aimed for a small volcanic knob where I would have to decide between a snow field (and saving some elevation), and dropping down a few hundred feet to connect with the road sooner. I chose to drop down, and wrapped around the volcanic knob. As I wrapped around, I kept seeing snow on the road, so I decided to just remain uphill. This continued until I reached what looked like the last few patches of snow on the road.\nNear the low point between East and Middle Sisters\nA little volcanic knob below the ridge\nEast and Middle Sisters\nA use trail leading straight down to the road, I didn’t end up taking this\nThe last major snow was a very large drift at the top of a hill that split east from west. I did some small glissading down this to finally make it down to the road. The drift was probably 15 feet high at its tallest point. This was a few thousand feet lower than the mountains I had just climbed, but by far the deepest snow I’d seen all day. The road was more or less a creek for a few hundred yards, so I walked alongside it just out of the reach of the water.The road dried out quickly, and I was soon enjoying the easiest miles of the day. It cut through the valley below East Sister, and I could see about where I had started from. In hindsight, taking the road up a bit higher may have been an easier ascent.\nThe towering snowdrift\nThe road quickly turned pretty rocky again, and passed through an area with a large pile of rocks held together by wire fencing. I’m sure there is some purpose for this pile of rocks, but it wasn’t clear to me. I continued down the road into a more forested section, and soon passed where I had cut up from the road that morning. The last section of the road flew by, and I was back at my truck before I knew it.\nCage of rocks\nI took my shoes off, and sat in my camping chair for a solid 10 minutes just looking up at East Sister. It was only about 2PM, so I had to decide what to do with the rest of my day. I ended up packing up my camp, and driving around the area a bit to get some intel for Desert Creek Peak the next day. I made it down to Desert Creek, and decided to turn my truck around after seeing how much water it had in it. The road crosses it 4 or 5 times to get to the regular route, so I decided against that. On my way back up the road, I decided to pull off on a random side road, and took that a mile or so to another side road where I found a nice place to camp for the night, complete with a great view of East and Middle Sisters.\nThe sisters from my campsite\nRoute Route is approximate, I didn’t record a proper GPX track GPX Track Download",
    "description": "May 27th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI took off work a few hours early at 3PM Friday, and already had mostly loaded my truck up for 3 days of camping. I had a few odds and ends to handle after, but was on the road by 3:30PM or so. I stopped to get gas and a few road snacks in Placerville, and was soon headed up highway 50. Somewhere shortly before Kyburz, it started to rain pretty hard. I stopped at the Silverfork store and moved a few things from my truck bed that weren’t waterproof into the cab. I made a quick stop in Gardnerville for some Jack in the Box Tacos, and then headed down 395.",

    "content": "May 20th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy alarm woke me up from a weird dream at 2:40AM. I can’t recall the specifics of it at this point, but I do recall there being some weird tribal music, kind of similar to the “Survivor” theme song. I hadn’t slept that well, and had a moderately painful lump in my throat the week leading up. Despite my discomfort, I had been dreaming about this peak all week. I did my morning routine as quietly as possible, and left my comfortable bed, wife and dog behind. I love them dearly, but this is more than they want to do in a day.\nI made a quick stop at Speedway in Placerville, and the 3AM tweakers were as active as they ever are. I grabbed a red bull, and some mini chocolate donuts to get my day started. I jammed up highway 50, and was at the trailhead around 4:40. After testing out the snow conditions and getting my gear ready, I was on the trail at 4:50. The trailhead was dry, but the snow started just a few feet behind the locked gate. I had my skis in an a-frame attached to my backpack, and opted to walk in my trail runners for as long as I could before switching over. I was a bit worried as the overnight temps were pretty high the night before, but I found the snow to still be supportive enough for walking.\nBefore long, I started to see the sun rise, and was able to take my headlamp off after about half an hour. I was able to maintain a pace of just above 2 miles per hour comfortably. The only complaint I had was that my splitboard setup was pretty heavy and seemed to be digging into my shoulders more than it usually does. I tried adjusting my backpack quite a few times to address this, but nothing seemed to fix it. For another hour or so, I was able to keep the same pace up with minimal post holing in the snow.\nStarting to see the sun\nThe route follows Willow Creek Road up Horse Canyon, and once the road started getting closer to the creek, the snow seemed to firm up even more. This was great, but I did end up finding a few sections of road that required me to side hill in slippery snow due to the way it had melted more on one side than the other. I did end up losing the route at one point where there was a fairly large opening, I had to check my map several times, and ultimately corrected it within about 20 minutes and got back on the road. Grove of aspens a mile or 2 in\nAnother healthy looking forest in Horse Canyon\nLooking up towards Freel Peak, El Dorado County’s highpoint\nBefore I knew it, I had knocked out nearly 5 miles, and the road had ended. At this point I tried my best to start following the summer trail up Job’s. This was quite a bit steeper than the road, but I was still finding my shoes to do the job. The snow got softer as I went up, and my feet and socks were already fairly wet at this point (I always carry 2 pairs for this reason). I just resigned to a bit more postholing, and continued up with moderately cold feet. I veered a bit off of the summer trail, but its not like there’s much difference when its all snow covered. The trees started to get more alpine looking and windswept as I continued my way up. Eventually, the last saddle below Job’s started to come into view. Looking back down the slope towards Horse Canyon\nI was still about a half mile away when the snow started forming a very slick crust on top. I was able to kick steps in most of the time, but eventually the shady spots became too difficult to kick into, and I started slipping. I found a nice tree to sit next to, and swapped into dry socks and my ski boots. It felt good to have the weight of the boots off of my back, but I immediately felt the strain of the added weight on my feet. This stretch was by far the most exhausting part of the day, my legs just did not want to be swinging my heavy ski boots up the steepish slope. I settled into my slower pace, and before too long, I started to see the snow disappear near the top of the ridge and give way to decomposed granite. This was arguably harder than the snow, but only lasted for a hundred yards or so.\nI still couldn’t quite see the peak from here, but after rounding a corner, it came into view, along with a lot of the Carson Valley. I took my phone out of airplane mode, and sent a quick text to my wife as I sat down and switched back over to wet socks and trail runners. The summer trail to the peak was mostly dry from here, save for one large snowfield that looked manageable in shoes. I left as much gear behind a possible to lighten my load, including the splitboard setup and my larger water bottle. The snowfield crossing was manageable, but the postholing was atrocious. Some steps I hardly punched through, and others were thigh deep. I despise spring post holing, its extremely frustrating and can definitely be dangerous. Regardless, I persevered and made it across the snowfield pretty quick, opting to gain some elevation so I could rock hop near the end. The summit coming into view\nNearing the summit triangle\nFrom here, I was about 300 vertical feet shy of the summit on a dry trail. I made relatively quick work of it, although I was definitely getting pretty gassed from the miles and altitude. The trail snaked along the side of the summit triangle, and as I got closer, I wasn’t quite sure which part was the summit as there were 2 distinct rock outcroppings near the top. As it turned out, the summit was to my right, and that became obvious as I came between the 2 points. The scramble to the very top wasn’t nearly as long as I had anticipated, and I topped out right at 10AM. Panorama from the top\nJob’s Sister and Freel Peak, another fantastic hike in the area\nI took a handful of pictures, and texted my wife from the top in addition to just soaking in the views. The roast beef sandwich I packed was absolutely delicious, and went great with some cheddar Sun Chips. I probably spent 20-30 minutes on top enjoying a hard earned lunch with a fantastic view. It was pretty cool looking down at the Wade Benchmark I had climbed the week before, along with all of the growing list of peaks in the area I can recognize. I still had a long trip back, and the snow was softening up quickly, so I decided to head back down.\nLunch with a view\nThe return trip across the snowfield was a bit easier as I was able to just reuse the steps I had made before. The places where I had postholed deep were definitely a pain to step over though. I made it back to my gear I had dropped, and once again switched back into dry socks and ski boots. After putting my splitboard together, and packing up my gear, I made the brief walk down the decomposed granite to the snow.\nThe snow was very soft, and it was more of survival boarding through the trees than anything glamorous or fast. I still had a good time, and was back down in the valley in short order. Down there, I started hearing the sound of 2 strong engines, and figured there must have been some snowmobilers in the area. After switching over to skis, the snowmobilers got closer and I saw them ripping through the trees. One stopped and we exchanged a quick wave, I was glad they were at least aware of my presence. I skied down through some trees, and soon was back on the road. It was baking hot down there, and I started needing to drink a lot more water. Looking back at Job from Horse Canyon\nThe next few miles were relatively uneventful, but I did start to notice I was running low on water. I saw a creek crossing not far ahead on the map, so held off until then. At the crossing, I realized I was on top of a wooden bridge (perhaps 6 feet above it on snow though), I had missed this when I lost the road that morning. I took my skis off, and brought my water bottle down to the creek. While trying to find a good way down to the snow, I broke off a big chunk of snow, and fell into the creek about knee deep. At least you know its an adventure when things start going wrong! In addition, I realized I didn’t have a filter, and the water had a bit more particulate than I cared for. It was all snowmelt, and the particulate was probably just forest duff that the creek picked up, but I was not stoked to drink it. I grabbed my spare base layer shirt from my backpack, and used that as a “filter” as I drank it for the rest of the trip. Thankfully my boots were wet, but it wasn’t cold enough for me to be concerned. The spot where I punched through into the creek\nAfter leaving the creek, I made a wrong turn and somehow almost took the wrong drainage all the way down to hope valley, several miles below where I was parked. Realizing my mistake, I had to trudge back uphill for about a quarter mile. I had made it this far without using skins, and really didn’t want to put them on now. So I made extra switchbacks, and the slushy snow somehow allowed me to barely eek out some uphill travel without skins. Eventually I got back on the road, and enjoyed being able to glide back down to the car with minimal stops. Down towards the bottom, it got a bit patchy, but I made it back to the car around 1:30PM. I was wet and tired, but beyond happy to see the car. All told, it was about a 15 mile round trip. Right as I made it to the car, I started hearing the first thunder I heard all day, perfect timing.

I even got in a rare May pow day the previous Sunday. Looking at the forecast though, it was pretty clear that this Saturday was set to be significantly hotter. I wanted to knock another Ogul peak off, and initially had planned to go climb Mt Rose. I left the house around 3:15AM, and while driving over Echo Summit got the idea to knock Wade off instead of Rose, and save the hour of driving. I wasn’t entirely sure that the trailhead would be thawed out, but I had a feeling it likely would be.\nSure enough, when I got there the parking area was well thawed out. I parked the truck, strapped my skis in an a frame on my backpack, and set out to find the trailhead in the dark, it was around 5:15AM. I found the trail after a few minutes of stumbling around in the dark, and was soon making my way up some steep switchbacks. The trail immediately felt more like the Eastern Sierra than the Tahoe area. It was steep and rocky with plants that reminded me more of the desert than what you typically see in Tahoe. The switchbacks didn’t last too long, and soon they opened up into a route that goes directly up Horsethief Canyon. According to some research, it got its name because of the “horse thieves” who would steal horses from emigrants in Woodfords Canyon, and take them up Horsethief canyon to graze its meadows. The rocky switchbacks near the start\nThe trail along the canyon was fairly steep, and soon crossed through a small grove of aspens. Not long after this, patches of snow started showing up. I was hiking in my crocs, and was pretty stubborn about not wanting to put my ski boots on yet. I took this a bit too far, and soon the trail was more snow than dry patches. My crocs did pretty well, but I started slipping more and more. I pushed this a bit farther than I really should have, and finally decided to acquiesce near the top of the steeper part of the canyon about a mile in. A cool volcanic feature and Hawkins Peak in the distance\nAfter putting on my ski boots, I was able to make much better time than in my crocs. The snow was firm, so I was happy to just walk along in my boots for as long as I could before switching to skinning. The route grew a lot more mellow, and I continued along through some really nice old looking Ponderosa and Logdepole pines. Clearly this area has managed to avoid the logging that has taken place in most of California that’s accessible by vehicles. People say that logging prevents wildfires, but when you compare old growth to second growth, I think that argument falls flat on its face. A large Ponderosa(?) Pine after the canyon flattened out\nI continued along the west side of the creek through the woods for about 3/4 of a mile. After that, I crossed the creek near where I saw a road on my topo map and started making my way up a long ridge. The ridge had some monster Juniper trees, which are some of my favorite trees. They just seem wise to me for some reason, they’re never the tallest, but they can be stout. Somewhere around ~8200 feet, the grove of Junipers eventually gave way to a long, low angled opening that continued up towards the top. The snow here was still surprisingly smooth, and I started to realize that I might actually get some good turns in. I had resigned to this just being a long walk through the woods, but I’ll always take good snow if its available. Junipers on the east slope of the canyon\nAfter perhaps an hour, I topped out on the ridge around 9200 feet, and finally decided it was time to switch to skinning as the snow on top was getting softer. Once I started skinning, I realized I started debating whether or not it would have been more efficient to have switched over sooner. Regardless, I was making good time across the relatively flat ridge top. Even though Wade was less than 200 vertical feet higher, I still had about 1.2 miles to go. This was fine with me, as the views from the area were incredible, and I had the whole place to myself. The gentle open face leading up the ridge\nLooking back towards Carson Pass from ~9000ft\nAfter a bit, I went under a really cool looking volcanic rock feature, the whole day really felt more like I was in the southwest than the Tahoe area. Not too far beyond that, Wade came into view, and I saw that there would be a bit of a downhill to get to Wade. I came up to a cornice that was about 10’ tall, and managed to side slip down it with my skis, and did my best to stay on the highest point possible connecting the 2 points. Before long, I was at the base of the summit block of Wade. I dropped my skis here, and made a short bushwhack/rock scramble to the top. Another cool volcanic feature\nThe views from the top were spectacular. I could see the whole Carson pass area pretty well, down into Gardnerville, northeast towards the Freel-Job’s ridge, and the Ebbett’s pass area to the south. I signed the register, and was surprised to see nobody had signed it since October of last year. There was another older register box, and unfortunately the contents were mostly ruined by water. However, I did see a signature from 1989 which was pretty cool. I hung out for perhaps 10-15 minutes, and started making my way back down. Once I got back to my skis, it was pretty smoooth sailing back to the top of the ridge I had ascended that morning. I stopped here for a good 20 minutes to take my ski boots off for a few minutes and enjoy a nice snack break. Panorama from the top of Wade\nWhat remains of the old register\nAfter eating, I transitioned my splitboard and took off down the ridge. I knew it was really easy going terrain, so I had opted to leave my helmet this time. Of course that meant I forgot to take off my hat, which flew off within 15 seconds or so of starting off on my snowboard. I made the annoying hike back up to go grab it, and then set off again. The corn was perfect, and I enjoyed some awesome, wide open turns for a bit, before coming to a wall of trees a lot sooner than expected. I checked the map, and I had veered a bit in the wrong direction, and was going down a different drainage. I unstrapped, and hiked across the slope back towards the way I came up (perhaps a few hundred yards at most). The snow was still perfect over here, and I flew down about a mile in just a few minutes.\nMellow turns back down to the creek\nI crossed the creek a bit southeast of where I had crossed in the morning, but still had no issues. I put my headphones in, and listened to a podcast as I worked my way back through the forest. After about an hour, I was back at the top of the Canyon. I was a bit higher than my approach, so I had to walk down some fairly steep dirt. On my way down, I found an old mini shovel which I packed out. Its technically litter, and I can use the shovel. Win win. I made it back to my truck around 12:20 or so. My GPS stats said it was about a 9 mile journey that took just a few minutes shy of 8 hours. One last view of Hawkins peak and the before descending\nI can see why this isn’t a super popular peak to hike, its not very prominent, and there are a ton of other cooler looking peaks nearby to draw you away. That said, I’m glad this was on the Ogul list as it forced me to go have a really nice tranquil day in the woods. I didn’t see another soul while I was out there, and the scenery was fantastic in more than one way. Definitely give this peak a try if you’re looking for a nice easy ski and some solitude.\nRoute My route GPX Track Download",

    "content": "April 8th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy goal this winter has simply been to log as many days as possible on my splitboard. It brings me joy regardless of the conditions, a day out splitboarding is a good day. That said, I’ve also been (very) slowly chipping away at the Tahoe Ogul Peak List, and Rubicon was one of the closer ones that I hadn’t ticked off yet. In addition, the conditions lined up in a way that the snow would probably still be decent there.\nI wanted to get an earlyish start, so I set my alarm for 4am Saturday morning. I say earlyish, because 2:45am is usually when my “early” alarm for mountain adventures usually goes off. It hurts, but watching the sunrise from a mountain is always worth it. Plus I usually don’t feel too tired once I get a Yerba Mate or a Redbull in me. I was out the door by 4:30 or so, I can’t recall exactly but that seems accurate. Made a quick stop at the Pollock Pines Safeway for some snacks (a terrible grocery store, but it’s on the way and open 24 hours).\nI arrived at the trailhead, which is really just a dead end street. I had never been here before, but understood that parking here was a contentious subject. I’m all for being respectful of neighborhoods, but it’s a dead end street, and you shouldn’t need to be a millionaire to access our public lands. I parked my truck as out of the way as possible, and was off right around 7am.\nMy Truck with a beautiful Tahoe sunrise behind it\nI was a little bit torn on which track to follow right after starting, one took a left up ~50 vertical feet higher onto a ridge than the other, and I ended up opting for that one. There were a lot of return tracks through here, so it seemed like the right place to be. The elevation gain was fairly gradual for a while, and soon it opened up to a beautiful long bench heading straight towards the peak. The trees here were clearly very old, something about being among old growth trees really puts me into a peaceful place. As the forest opened up, so did the magnificent views of Tahoe. It was really shaping up to be a nice morning out on the west shore.\nRubicon peak first coming into view from near the start The “bench” below Rubicon\nThe bench eventually connected to the steeper northeast face of Rubicon, and the trees seemed to get a bit more dense, and the terrain a good bit steeper. I continued along an established skin track up until somewhere around 8200 feet, where I lost it in the wind blown snow and some recent descent tracks. Not to worry though, the plan was pretty simple at this point: go up until you can’t anymore. The view of Tahoe from somewhere near where I lost the skin track\nDefinitely one of the more scenic tours I’ve done in the Tahoe area\nThe forest seemed to open up a bit more as I got closer to the top. This were some really nice old trees, and I was having a great time moving through them. I was keeping a really solid pace the whole way up, probably the best pace I had been on all winter. Things always come together during the spring in the mountains. Speaking of spring, it still wasn’t quite feeling like spring. It had snowed a few inches the day before, and there was probably as much as 4 or 5 inches of windblown powder up near the top in shaded areas. Conditions were better than I had been expecting.\nThe tree spacing opening up\nAwesome Conditions near the top\nI made the final push up to the summit block, and was just about a hundred vertical feet from the top around 8:50AM. About 2100 vertical feet of climbing down, and half of which breaking trail, in less than 2 hours. I was pretty stoked with my work. This pace doesn’t come naturally for me, apparently several years of running on my lunch break are starting to work. The final ridge leading to the peak\nThe summit of Rubicon peak is a big steep rock face that probably ranges between class 3 and 5 depending on where you climb it from. I dropped my skis at the edge of the snow and circled around to the west side of the peak. From here I found a route up the rocks that was barely doable in ski boots. I managed to make it to the top, although I didn’t fully stand on it. I kind of just poked my head over and touched it with my hands. Maybe that counts, maybe it doesn’t. I’m sure I’ll be back at some point anyways so I’m not too worried either way. I made my way back down to my skis and saw a lady and her poodle had made their way up as well. We chatted for a few minutes as I got my splitboard ready. The view to the east from the summit Looking southeast Looking southwest into Desolation\nI dropped in and more or less tried to follow my tracks from the way up as I was still not super familiar with the terrain. The snow was somewhat variable, but mostly really good. There were some really fun big open sections with great soft snow and an even better view of Tahoe. I stopped once or twice to let my legs recover, but it was a pretty quick return trip. I saw a few groups down on the big bench that leads to the steeper section, and we exchanged some waves and mutual stoke as I passed by. The final section down to the car was a bit icy, but wasn’t too bad. I made it back to the truck somewhere around 9:30. The parking area was completely filled up, I was glad I had turned my truck around so the exit was easy.\nI drove back to highway 50, and stopped off at Sierra at Tahoe for a few hours of resort riding. I had just snagged their deal for a pass for the remainder of spring, plus the rest of next year for 400 bucks, not bad. This was my first time at a resort in probably 5 years. Sierra has always been my favorite resort in Tahoe. It’s definitely changed post Caldor fire but the vibe is still the same, and I still knew my way around. All in all, a fantastic day of snowboarding and enjoying the mountains.\nPyramid Peak in the distance from the Nob Hill Chair at Sierra",

    "content": "July 27, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nI was a few days away from turning 30, and noticed that I had 94 peaks climbed on my peakbagger page. A new mini goal quickly came to mind: get to 100 before I turned 30. I started browsing local peaks, and noticed that there were quite a few concentrated around Echo Lakes that I hadn’t climbed before. Sure, a few had hardly any prominence, but they show up on Peakbagger, so that’s good enough for me. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:15 or so, and was out the door not too long after.\nAs usual, getting parking at Echo Lakes is near impossible, especially on a Saturday morning. I gave up on parking near the lake, and ended up down the road, basically all the way back at the sno park. This added about a mile each way, which wasn’t terrible. I walked up the road a bit before cutting across to the PCT near Berkley Camp. The trail had a bit of uphill to it, but was pretty quick and easy to get to the lakes and proper trailhead.\nOn the PCT before Echo Lakes\nI stopped at the trailhead to fill out a quick Desolation permit, despite not being 100% sure if I’d ever even actually be in the wilderness. After that, I crossed the dam and was on my way up the trail. My first goal of the day was peak 7758, called “Dumbo” by some. No idea where that name came from. Unfortunately, I pulled a bit of a dumbo move, and walked past the best place to head towards Dumbo, so I just cut up towards Flagpole Peak. I would come back for Dumbo on the return trip. There was a tiny bit of bushwhacking to get up onto the ridge, but nothing that slowed me down much. Soon I was on the ridge, with a great view of Tahoe.\nCutting off trail towards Flagpole Peak\nThe climb up to Flagpole was some of the more interesting climbing of the day, with some solid class 3 scrambling, and a good bit of route finding required. Without too much drama though, I was soon at the base of the summit block. The summit itself is a large, somewhat slabby piece of granite with moderate exposure. I found the easiest way up was to swing out around to the west side, and come up that way. The pole at the top had a few flags, along with some discarded undergarments. After taking a few pictures, I climbed back down to where I had stashed my poles, and set off for the next peak.\nFlagpole Peak summit panorama\nA difficult selfie opportunity to pass up\nWhile descending Flagpole to the saddle to the north, I seemed to make all the wrong choices of route, having to either slowly downclimb sketchier than necessary options, or turn around in some cases. Soon enough though, I was down at the saddle, and heading back up. I made my way around an outcropping of granite before Echo Peak came into view, with a nice use trail leading to the summit. The climb up to Echo Peak was some of the nicest walking I would do all day.\nCool granite between Flagpole and Echo\nAs I neared the summit, I wasn’t entirely sure where the actual summit was, there were two places that looked like possible summits. I went to the more eastern one first, which I determined to indeed be the proper summit. There was an old dead tree that was partially burned, and cut up with a chainsaw into smaller pieces. My guess is that this was done while fighting the Caldor Fire in 2021. The view from here was even better than that of Flagpole, with expansive views of the Crystal Range, Tahoe, and the Ebbett’s Pass area.\nThe trail leading up Echo Peak\nEcho Peak summit panorama\nNorth of Echo Peak, the use trail continued for a bit, but I cut off to the east shortly to head towards Indian Rock. I once again picked up a decent use trail, although that more or less fizzled out as the ridge turned into blocks of granite. It wasn’t very obvious to me which part of the ridge Indian Rock was, as its more known for being a rock climbing route, and doesn’t have much (if any) prominence. With that in mind, I mostly stuck to the top of the ridge to make sure I hit the summit. I eventually pulled out my map, and got a pretty good idea of where it was.\nNearing Indian Rock\nIndian Rock panorama\nMy next stop was Angora Peak, a proper peak with some prominence, and about a quarter mile or so east along the ridge. I dropped down to the low point between the 2, and started making my way up the granite shelves that make up the west side of the peak. The climbing here was pretty fun class 2, sprinkled with a few class 3 moves. The top offered by far the best view of the day, with Fallen Leaf Lake looking very cool. I hung out here for 15-20 minutes and ate some lunch before heading back down. For the return, I dropped a bit further to the south, and was able to traverse a mix of DG and bushes, which seemed easier than descending the granite steps.\nClimbing the last bit of Angora Peak\nAngora peak summit panorama\nFallen Leaf and Tahoe\nFrom the saddle between Angora and Indian Rock, I again opted to stick to the south, which eventually turned into boulder hopping along granite. I’m not 100% convinced this saved me any time, but it didn’t make things any harder either. I was soon back atop the ridge, and set off out into the woods to find my way back down to the PCT. The first half or so of this descent was easy, just walking through old growth trees and some tall grass. Further down though, it devolved into a full on downhill bushwhack. My legs took a nice beating from all the bushes, but I eventually prevailed, popping out near a weather station just above the PCT. I walked by the weather station, and stepped on something under the rocks that gave way a bit, feeling like a piece of deformed sheet metal. I’m pretty sure this was a snow sensor (sorry snow survey people!).\nBushwhacking galore\nA weather station\nOnce back on the PCT, I had a short walk before a very brief detour up to Red Hill. This required about 100’ of elevation gain, and had a somewhat boring summit. Despite the lackluster views, someone had taken quite a bit of effort to build a completely unnecessary rock shelter. I snapped a few pictures, and was soon heading back down to the PCT.\nRed Hill panorama\nOn the PCT, there were quite a few people coming down the trail, including easily 5 unleashed dogs within 30 minutes. I love dogs, but don’t be that person, leash your dog when you’re on a popular trail. I continued along, trying my best not to be too jealous of the cabins that line the lake’s shore. I finally came to the point on the trail below the saddle between Dumbo Peak and Flagpole Peak, and went up towards the ridgeline. I made it up, not far from where I had gone up that morning, and started south towards Dumbo. The climb was pretty easy, a few hundred vertical feet with a small amount of bushwhacking. As I got about 50’ away from the summit, an ammo box caught my eye. This was the typical kind used for summit registers, but it was painted to blend in with the surrounding granite. I thought that was a bit weird, but realized it was a geocache when I opened it. I signed my name, and went over to the proper summit, which is a pair of rocks split by a moderate sized crack. It was an easy climb to get on top of them, which has a fantastic view.\nThe geocache\nDumbo panorama\nI hung out for a few minutes to grab some pictures, and started heading down back towards the Echo Lake dam. My route took me down the ridge a bit, before descending some slabby granite to catch the last bit of the trail. The trail was quite crowded, and I got stuck behind a large group of older hikers moving quite slowly. Thankfully I was in no rush, and was able to get around them at the dam. From there, I opted to take the road back to my truck rather than the PCT. Near the truck, I ran into a sheriff and forest service LEO handing out tickets. I asked them what the criteria was, and they told me to basically just park all 4 wheels off the roadway. Seems perfectly reasonable, and I was happy to see the moron who parked their van literally IN the road got a ticket. Again, don’t be that guy…\nAll of these people deserved the tickets they got\nRoute GPX Track Download",

A new mini goal quickly came to mind: get to 100 before I turned 30. I started browsing local peaks, and noticed that there were quite a few concentrated around Echo Lakes that I hadn’t climbed before. Sure, a few had hardly any prominence, but they show up on Peakbagger, so that’s good enough for me. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:15 or so, and was out the door not too long after.",

    "content": "July 21, 2024 Full Image Gallery\nI got up at around 4AM and made coffee and a sandwich to get the day started. By 4:30 I was out the door and on my way to Loon Lake. I’ve driven up Wentworth Springs Road countless times, but I had never done it while the sun was rising. The sunrise definitely adds to the experience, I highly recommend it.\nAt around 5:40, I arrived at the Rubicon Staging area, and managed to squeeze into a parking spot next to some trucks with trailers attached. I believe some sort of event (not the Jeeper’s Jamboree) was going on that day. After parking I grabbed my gear for the day and set off. The walking along the Rubicon was not any more difficult than a standard hiking trail. There are some big rocks at time, but being a human makes it a lot easier to get around those than if you were a Jeep. At this hour, nobody was on the road, nor did I see many people even awake. I pretty much had the trail to myself, although I did try to be quiet while passing people camped out on the side of the road.\nNear the start of the Rubicon at Loon Lake\nThe trail starts off on some granite slabs, and goes up a bit, before dropping down into a bit of a granite valley, which it then goes back up. This section would be easy to cut across, but goes through some private property, so that’s probably not advisable. After the slabby granite, the trail goes into some more wooded sections for a bit, although the granite seems to be a pretty consistent theme, as are the oil streaks. At mile 1.5 there is a stone marker indicating the end of the Loon Lake Intertie, which I believe is the entrance most people use, despite the true start of the trail being at the far end of Wentworth Springs Rd.\nThe sunrise was fantastic\nOverlooking Loon Lake\nNot far beyond the marker, I came to a steel bridge, which led to the side road I’d need to take that cuts off of the Rubicon Trail to the north. I passed a guy walking very slowly in his pajamas towards the bathroom on the other side of the bridge. He had clearly just woken up, there were a few groups that had camped here. The road was gated off, and had a clearing at the start that seemed to be in the middle of being worked on by a parked Bobcat. The road was high quality, much smoother than the Rubicon Trail. It was more or less completely flat and very well graded and cleared; those were the easiest miles of the day by far. As the road got closer to Guide Peak, several springs seemed to flow into the drainage ditch along the east side of the road.\nThe road towards Guide Peak\nBefore long at all, I was slightly northwest of Guide Peak, where the road veered to the west, and a small opening in the forest opens up towards Guide Peak’s north ridge. I departed from the road, and made my way up the clearing. Stumps reveal that the clearing was logged, although probably a while ago as new (but small) trees have been planted, and some medium sized ferns cover the hillside. Despite the ferns and small trees, I wouldn’t consider any of it a bushwhack. I cut to the north as I reached a wall of brush, and mostly skirted it as I crossed through a small stand of older trees that weren’t logged. That deposited me very close to the Granite, I just had to cross perhaps a hundred feet of low brush.\nJust north of the peak\nOnce at the granite, Guide Peak started to feel like a proper Sierra Peak. I climbed up a very high quality bounder field, the granite was light colored, extremely stable, and in fairly large pieces. There are some bushes that make there way a bit higher up the mountain than other areas, but I manged to find a nice path that avoided it completely. I climbed up the last few hundred feet in perhaps 10-15 minutes at most, and came to the crest where I though I’d find the summit.\nAt the summit ridge\nAs I crested, I realized that I’d need to do a bit of a ridge traverse to get to the proper summit, which was clearly one of 2 points a few hundred feet to my south. The ridge walk was quite enjoyable, and felt quite aesthetic for a peak so far north in the Sierra. I made it to the first possible summit, snapped a few pictures, and then went to the further south option where I spent more time. I’m still not 100% sure which part is the proper summit, but if you’re there already, the south end of the summit ridge has better views of Loon Lake.\nSummit Panorama\nLoon Lake, the Crystal Range, and Dick’s and Jack’s Peaks in the distance\nThe views were quite good for such an obscure peak. The northern Crystal Range, Dick’s and Jack’s Peaks, Snow Mountain, English Mountain, and many other mountain’s I’ve climbed were visible. I also particularly liked the view of Loon Lake, which I’ve been enjoying for probably over 20 years now. After some time enjoying the view, I started making my way back across the ridge, and down the boulder field. The climb down was pretty easy, although I opted to see if there was a quicker way than the clearing I had taken up, which cost me some time bushwhacking. Once back on the road, I started to cruise pretty well. I had told my family I’d meet them at the Tell’s Creek Equestrian Camp about 30 minutes down the road at 10AM. It was about 8:15AM, so I wasn’t in a big rush, but didn’t have time to dilly-dally.\nLooking back at the quality granite on the summit ridge\nAs I neared the end of the dirt road, I started hearing more and more engine noise from the Rubicon, it was clear that my return trip would be a bit less peaceful. Sure enough, as soon as I got onto the Rubicon, a group of perhaps 5-6 side by side UTVs passed me, followed by a dad and son in a Jeep going in the same direction as me. I crossed the bridge, and got into a groove of moving fast, but keeping an ear open for approaching vehicles, and getting out of their way. Often I’d be able to bushwhack along the side of the trail so I didn’t need to stop. Everyone that passed me seemed very kind, and were all in good moods. Several people stopped and chatted for a few minutes.\nGuide Peak still hiding the sun\nBefore too long, I had actually caught up with the father/son duo in the Jeep, and sheepishly passed them on the right, crashing through some bushes to get the advantage. I continued along, and caught up with another group of older trucks near the granite bowl, and managed to pass them as well in the wide open country. After a bit more quick hiking, I was back at the Rubicon staging area and my truck.\nCrossing the granite bowl\nI made my way to where I was set to meet my family, and they showed up within 5 minutes of me. We then went down to our favorite swimming hole to enjoy the water for a few hours.\nGeorge enjoying the water\nRoute GPX Track Download",

    "content": "Background There are quite a few ways you can authenticate over SSH, I’ll outline what seem to be the most popular ones:\nProbably the most common is to just use a password, this is neither enjoyable for the user, nor is it the most secure way to do things. If you have password auth enabled on a public facing server, its going to get hammered with attempts from bots all day. You can install Fail2ban, which might stop the most unsophisticated of attacks, but attackers are smart enough to try from multiple IP addresses now. There’s a project called Crowdsec that dubs itself “The spiritual successor to Fail2ban”, which does this a bit more intelligently by using a crowd sourced list of bad IPs. Even with this in place though, don’t use password auth. Just don’t, use the next option at bare minimum.\nThe next best option is to use keypairs. This consists of a private key (only you have this private key, hence the name), and a public key (this key lives in the authorized_keys file on the server you’re trying to connect to). The private key is used to decrypt a message sent by the target server which was encrypted by the public key. The private key is the only thing that can decrypt this message, provided you’re using a strong algorithm (ed25519 is what most people recommend these days). This is a whole lot better than a password, but there are still some issues. This is putting a lot of trust on the machine where the private key lives, which is presumably somebody’s laptop or workstation. I’ve come top learn over the years of working in IT that workstations can be scary places. People use them to browse the web, and often to install sketchy shit they downloaded from the web.\nWhat if there was a way to leverage a trusted server to authenticate the user, rather than just blindly trusting the private key on the users machine? That’s where ssh certificates come in. With certificates, rather than having a target machine trust a public key tied to a user’s private key, we have that target server trust a public key signed by a CA. That certificate authority gets requests from the user to sign a certificate that leverages the keypair that lives on their machine. This is basically ssh keys on steroids. Ultimately the decision of whether or not somebody can access the target server gets moved to the CA, not the user’s machine. This pattern has gained a lot of popularity in the past few years. Its fairly trivial to set up for a proof of concept, you just need a CA, and can sign certificates with some openssl commands. On the target machine, you just need the root CA’s public key, and a simple one line modification to the sshd config file. Managing this at scale is where things tend to get tricky however. A few companies have come up with products that make this easier to manage at scale. I’ve tried a few of them and will give some brief opinions below.\nCommercial Offerings Smallstep - Fairly simple to set up, reliable and consistent. You can set up an external IDP which will do the authentication piece. Basically just log in with Google, or whatever you use, and its that easy for users. They offer a free tier, so if you wanted to use this at home, you should have no issues. That said, its very basic and really doesn’t offer the cleanest end user experience. Configuring target hosts felt a bit clunky compared to other options. This was a really solid option all things said though.\nBastionZero - Very secure and cool technology at play. They use a double root of trust, meaning if your IDP got compromised, the attacker would also need to compromise BastionZero’s systems. The people behind it are brilliant, like some seriously smart people, so I’d say this may be the most secure option available. They don’t offer a free tier as far as I can tell, so not a great homelab option. When we demoed this at work, it still felt a bit immature, there were a good bit of bugs we encountered with the client, and it felt a bit heavy compared to other options (this doesn’t use the regular ssh binary, it uses its own proprietary one). Perhaps the biggest downfall of their architecture was that all of your traffic gets routed through the cloud, this resulted in slow performance compared to a regular ssh session.\nStrongDM - This option uses regular ssh under the hood, as SmallStep does as well. They offer a command line client, as well a a GUI client, both of which are very easy to use and user friendly. They also leverage an external IDP (including SAML and OIDC), SmallStep offers OIDC but not SAML. Configuring target hosts is very simple, just add the root CA key somewhere on the machine, and edit a single line of the ssh config. They do not offer a free tier, and the pricing isn’t the cheapest thing in the world. That said, its a really solid product and by far the best choice for an enterprise in my opinion. Its very much a “set it and forget it” type of product.\nTeleport - I have never used this one, but thought it was worth mentioning. It seems a bit “heavy” based on my research, you can’t just use the regular openssh client, you need to use their proprietary one. It does offer a free tier, so this may be worth checking out. I’ve heard good things about it.\nHashicorp Vault - Vault offers a ssh certificate secrets engine on top of the other variety of things it does. Its probably the most basic of the options listed above, and not something I tested out at work. Vault basically provides the CA, and some fairly simple vault commands to request certificates, leveraging whatever method you use to authenticate to the Vault with. Its not at all fancy, and not very user friendly out of the box. That said, I already run a Vault at home, and its something a lot of companies already have. Vault has an open source offering, and in my opinion Hashicorp really does a good job of differentiating their paid and free product without coming off as greedy. The free open source Vault is great, and if you have a lot of secrets to store, you can really get a lot of value for free with it.\nWith all of this in mind, I chose to use Vault for my home use. I’ll be showing how I set up Vault as my ssh cert CA, as well as a script I wrote to make it a bit more user friendly.\nVault Configuration This all assumes you have a Hashicorp Vault up and running already. There are plenty of guides put there on how to do this (including one on this blog about how to set it up in Kubernetes). It’s also assumed that you have the proper permissions to do all of this on your Vault.\nFirst we need to configure the Vault’s SSH signing secret engine. All of these steps are also available in Hashicorp’s documentation, so if you get stuck, or something seems unclear, make sure to check there.\nvault secrets enable -path=ssh-client-signer ssh Note that the path here is completely up to you, this was what the example in the Vault documentation uses, and I saw no need to change it personally.\nNext we need to create a CA key, you are able to use an existing one as well, but I prefer to just leave the private key in the Vault and never see it.\nvault write ssh-client-signer/config/ca generate_signing_key=true The last thing we need for the Vault is a signing role, modify the command below as needed, and run it to create your role. The most important thing to pay attention to is the default user, this user needs to exist on the target server.\nvault write ssh-client-signer/roles/ssh-user -\u003c\u003c\"EOH\" { \"algorithm_signer\": \"rsa-sha2-256\", \"allow_user_certificates\": true, \"allowed_users\": \"*\", \"allowed_extensions\": \"permit-pty,permit-port-forwarding\", \"default_extensions\": { \"permit-pty\": \"\" }, \"key_type\": \"ca\", \"default_user\": \"yourUser\", \"ttl\": \"30m0s\" } EOH Target Server Configuration Log into one of the machines you want to use as a target, ie one you plan to ssh into with these certificates. Run the command below to write out the public key for the Vault CA we just created into the /etc/ssh directory. Make sure to replace the \u003cyour vault address\u003e section with the actual address of your Vault (don’t forget the port if not listening on port 443 or 80)\ncurl -o /etc/ssh/trusted-user-ca-keys.pem https://\u003cyour vault address\u003e/v1/ssh-client-signer/public_key Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and add the following line to the end of it:\nTrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/trusted-user-ca-keys.pem Finally, restart sshd to load the new config systemctl restart sshd\nScript Here is where the script comes in, the process of creating a key, and requesting a cert from Vault is a bit convoluted, and immediately struck me as something I wouldn’t want to need to do all the time. That’s why I spent a bit of time writing this script. It should handle creating the ssh keypair for you if it doesn’t exist, as well as requesting the cert from Vault. It then will also save the cert to a file, make sure the permissions are correct on the cert, and add the private key to your ssh agent. The goal here was being able to ssh into the target server without much more fuss than just using a regular ssh key. This results in short lived ssh access that’s tied to your Vault authentication rather than a key that sits around on your machine indefinitely.\n#!/bin/bash TYPE=ed25519 KEY=id_\"$TYPE\"_\"$1\" if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then echo \"Key name not provided. Use syntax 'cert \u003cdesired_key_name\u003e' next time!\" exit 1 fi if test -f \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"; then vault write -field signed_key ssh-client-signer/sign/my-role public_key=@\"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\".pub \u003e \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub chmod 600 \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub ssh-add ~/.ssh/\"$KEY\" else echo $HOME/.ssh/$KEY ssh-keygen -t $TYPE -a 100 -f $HOME/.ssh/$KEY vault write -field signed_key ssh-client-signer/sign/my-role public_key=@\"$HOME/.ssh/$KEY.pub\" \u003e \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub chmod 600 \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub ssh-add ~/.ssh/\"$KEY\" fi So in practice, you can just run this script with a single argument, that argument being the name of your desired key. So if I wanted to use a key named “test”, and had saved the script as cert.sh I would run the script as cert.sh test, which would create a few files for me:\nid_ed25519_test.pub - standard pubkey id_ed25519_test - standard private key id_ed25519_test-cert.pub - signed ssh certificate The script will also add the private key to your ssh agent. With the naming convention it follows, the agent should be able to automatically find the signed cert, and you should be able to ssh into servers without needing to pass any additional arguments. If that doesn’t work for some reason, you can simply pass the cert with the -i flag, ie ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_test-cert.pub me@myserver.com\nFinally, to make this a bit easier, you can put the script somewhere in your path, such as /usr/local/bin/cert. You can then simply call it with cert \u003cname of desired cert\u003e, so my workflow to ssh into a server looks like this:\nCreate the cert cert mycert SSH into the server as you normally would, ssh myserver That’s it, as long as your ssh-agent is running, this should work without any additional steps. You may need to specify a user if the user on the target server differs from your local user, ie ssh mischa@myserver. I hope someone finds this interesting some day, I really enjoy using this setup for all of my home ssh needs.",

    "content": "Hashicorp Vault I have spent quite a bit of time over the past 6 months setting up Hashicorp Vault at work. Its been a fun experience, and I have learned a lot. I’m always a fan of running whatever I run at work in my homelab, and Vault has really proven to be a useful tool. Recently, I’ve been playing around with Kubernetes again, and figured Vault would be a great place to store my Kubernetes secrets. In this post, I’ll try to outline how I set up Vault on my cluster, and how I use it with other apps on the cluster.\nPrerequisites I opted to use AWS KMS to unseal the Vault, this requires creating a KMS key on AWS first. You don’t need to do this if you’re fine manually unsealing the vault. To me this is worth the cost of slightly less than a dollar a month. I’m not going to get into the weeds about how to create a KMS key. You basically just need the key, and an IAM role and credentials. There are plenty of good guides out there like this one.\nA cluster you have control over (obviously). I’m running a 5 node k3s cluster, I used this repo as a jumping off point to deploy it with Ansible.\nHelm installed on your machine that can control your cluster.\nHelm Chart Now that we have a cluster and an (optional) KMS key, we can get to deploying the Valut. I opted to use the Helm chart provided by Hashicorp, this is by far the easiest way I have come across to install apps in Kubernetes, and seems to be the industry favorite.\nThe fist step was to install the Helm repo and update Helm’s repos\nhelm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com \u0026\u0026 helm repo update Now we need to create some Kubernetes secrets for our AWS KMS config. This may seem a bit confusing, as we are creating the Vault to store secrets in, but we don’t have that yet, so a Kubernetes secret will work for now.\nFirst we need to base64 encode the secrets. I did this from WSL on my laptop, any Linux machine will do, and there is probably a way to do it on Windows and MacOS. To encode a string, use the following syntax (make sure to use the -n flag for echo, or it will include a newline character and really mess up your day) echo -n \u003cyourStringHere\u003e | base64 Encode each of the values in the yaml snippet shown below, and create a file like it named secret.yaml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: namespace: vault name: vault type: Opaque data: AWS_REGION: \u003cbase64 here\u003e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: \u003cbase64 here\u003e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: \u003cbase64 here\u003e VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID: \u003cbase64 here\u003e With that out of the way, we can create our values.yaml. I chose to do an HA setup with raft storage, but you can use standalone if you don’t want the extra overhead. You can find a good overview of what to use in your values.yaml on Hashicorp’s Website\nglobal: enabled: true server: extraSecretEnvironmentVars: - envName: AWS_REGION secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_REGION - envName: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - envName: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - envName: VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID secretName: vault secretKey: VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID dev: enabled: false standalone: enabled: false ha: enabled: true config: | ui = true listener \"tcp\" { tls_disable = 1 address = \"[::]:8200\" cluster_address = \"[::]:8201\" } seal \"awskms\" {} service_registration \"kubernetes\" {} storage \"raft\" { path = \"/vault/data\" } raft: enabled: true setNodeId: true config: | ui = true listener \"tcp\" { tls_disable = 1 address = \"[::]:8200\" cluster_address = \"[::]:8201\" } seal \"awskms\" {} service_registration \"kubernetes\" {} storage \"raft\" { path = \"/vault/data\" } Now we can install it with helm upgrade --install vault hashicorp/vault -f values.yaml -n vault\nOnce the containers are created (check with kubectl -n vault get pods), exec into the first node and init the cluster kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-0 -- vault operator init\nJoin the second node kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-1 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200\nAnd the third node kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-2 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200\nYou should now have a running 3 node Vault cluster in Kubernetes. Nice work! It still needs a TLS cert and ingress created to access the Vault. For my certs, I use CertManager, and for ingress, I use Traefik. I won’t get into the weeds about how those are set up in this post, but I will leave some yaml snippets of them below. Happy Vaulting!\nCertificate --- apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: mischaf-us-prod namespace: vault spec: secretName: mischaf-us-production-tls issuerRef: name: letsencrypt-production kind: ClusterIssuer commonName: \"vault.mischaf.us\" dnsNames: - \"vault.mischaf.us\" Ingressroute apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRoute metadata: name: vault-gui namespace: vault annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik-external spec: entryPoints: - websecure routes: - match: Host(`vault.mischaf.us`) kind: Rule services: - name: vault-active port: 8200 namespace: vault tls: secretName: mischaf-us-production-tls",
    "description": "Hashicorp Vault I have spent quite a bit of time over the past 6 months setting up Hashicorp Vault at work. Its been a fun experience, and I have learned a lot. I’m always a fan of running whatever I run at work in my homelab, and Vault has really proven to be a useful tool. Recently, I’ve been playing around with Kubernetes again, and figured Vault would be a great place to store my Kubernetes secrets. In this post, I’ll try to outline how I set up Vault on my cluster, and how I use it with other apps on the cluster.",

    "content": "1/28/2023 This was my second tour of the year. I got a bit of a late start, but I had a busy start of the season dealing with the insane amount of rain I got at home. Thankfully that translates to a huge amount of snow in the mountains. I had enjoyed some awesome, waist deep powder on Waterhouse the weekend before, but I knew that the soft snow was going to be harder and harder to find. I also had to be in Oakland that night, so I wanted something relatively quick. Therefore I opted for some good old fashioned corn snow on the south face of Ralston.\nRecon shot of the Ralston Ridge I got the previous weekend\nI packed up my truck the night before, and was on the road by 5:30AM or so. Typically I’ve always been able to park at the Camp Sacramento sign and skin up from there. With all of the snow this year, I wasn’t able to park there, so I snagged a pull out a mile or so east of there, in one of the areas that seemed to get hit the hardest by the Caldor fire.\nLooking back at my truck\rLooking up towards the ridge\rI geared up, crossed highway 50 (probably the most dangerous part of the day’s journey), and started my way up. I started up the west side of the drainage directly in front of me, there was a decent amount of tree cover, but they were almost all dead from the fire. Just a few years before, this was a relatively healthy forest, and had a completely different aesthetic. It was definitely sad to see how intense the fire was through this section. I’m not a fire expert, but my understanding is that this was the second wildfire ever recorded to cross the Sierra crest (the other being the Dixie fire the same year). I tried my best to be optimistic, and thought about what the ride down would be like, which lifted my spirits a bit.\nDead Trees on the way up\rI was able to skin up about 500 vertical feet or so before deciding it was time to switch booting, as the snow was pretty firm and the slope was getting steeper. I continued up through the trees towards the ridgeline, changing my mind about which side to go up about half way up, and cutting a line more towards the east. Near the top, I switched back to skinning, and was on the ridge around 9:30 AM. From here it was a pretty mellow tour up to the next ridge that this one was connected to that runs to the proper summit of Mt Ralston.\nLooking northwest towards the Crystal Range\rMy last push up the ridge\rFrom here I had a great view of Sierra at Tahoe, the place where I learned to snowboard. Sierra will always hold a special place in my heart, even if I have all but given up on lift accessed snowboarding. The vibe there was always the most laid back of all of the resorts I ever went to, and I have fond memories of spending long days there with my friends as a teenager. West Bowl looks entirely different, much more of a proper bowl now. I read on their website that they harvested 5 million board feet of salvaged wood from the fire.\nSierra at Tahoe’s West Bowl\nI stopped for a quick snack near the top of a big rock face you can see from highway 50. The snow seemed to be warming up pretty quickly, so I decided I’d tour another 20 minutes to half an hour, and then start my descent. The summit was tempting, but not really steep enough for a smooth snowboard descent. I’ve been up Ralston more times than I can count, but this point on the ridge was new to me. From my high point I snapped a few pictures, and switched my splitboard over to ride mode. I contemplated which way to descend, going more to the west seemed a bit safer, but the snow over there was not very smooth due to all of the wind it gets. I love Ralston, but I’ve noticed over the years that the southwest side gets hammered by wind funneled up through the highway 50 corridor, which can often make for suboptimal riding conditions. I pondered for a minute or 2, and assessed that dropping into the more southeast side probably wasn’t too risky. The snow seemed pretty consolidated as it gets quite a bit of sun on it, and it also wasn’t abnormally warm for a January morning.\nThe view looking northeast from my high point\rWind affected snow on a southwest facing slope\rThe run I ended up taking started just to the right of the cluster of trees near the center-left of the picture\rNot wanting to waste any more time, I dropped in just south of Cup Lake, and enjoyed some fantastic wide open riding. My legs were a little shot due to being a bit low on electrolytes, but I managed to eek a good run out of it. I traversed the bowl below, and got to the top of the burned out trees and took a short break to let my legs bounce back a bit.\nLooking down on what ended up being a spectacular tree run\rThe ride through the trees was by far the best part of the day. The snow was right at the sweet spot of softness. I was able to make big sweeping turns through the now perfectly spaced trees. Forests that get burned this severely end up making some fantastic tree runs. The branches that would normally be slapping you all over your body are gone. What you’re left with is a perfect obstacle course to zig and zag through. The snow got a bit sticky towards the very bottom, but I was able to easily glide all the way back to the highway. I took a quick look back, snapped a few pictures, and disconnected from my bindings directly across the street from my truck. After waiting for what felt like an eternity for the endless line of cars on Highway 50, I crossed the road and was back in my truck before 11:15.\nOutside the Fox Theater\rI was home by 12:30, ate lunch and hung out for a few hours. That evening, me and my wife drove down to Oakland to see JID and Smino play at the Fox Theater. They put on a great show, and we were back home probably around 1:30AM. A perfect California day (maybe just a bit tiring), I love where I live.\nJID Performing at the Fox Theater",

    "content": "** Note, as of ~mid 2022, I moved over to Tailscale, and eventually Twingate. This was a fun project, but Twingate does the job without the cost of the VPS\nWhere I live there are essentially 2 options for(usable in this day and age) internet, you go with one of the local WISPs, or you use LTE in some form. The latter of the 2 is what I have ended up with after a few years of spotty and slow sevice with 2 different WISPs. It has some limitations, but I’m able to get 40-50Mbps down and 10-15Mbps up consistently. Someday Elon Musk and Starlink will save me, but for now it works. One of said limitations of using a Verizon LTE connection is Verizon’s CGNAT. This is Verizon’s way of continuing to use it’s finite supply of V4 addresses for a large pool of customers. This can be a big pain when trying to port forward services from you LAN to the internet(which probably isn’t the smartest thing to do anyways). That said, I do have some services on the LAN that are really handy to have access to while away from the house. The most important one for me is Home Assistant, but other things like Blue Iris, or even just being able to ssh into a box can come in really handy. While researching this issue, I initially avoided using VPNs as I had used Open VPN in the past, but wasn’t impressed by the performance or ease of setup. I successfully used a few things such as ssh tunnels, NGROK, and another project who’s name escapes me. All of them did the job, but had their quirks. It never really reached the level of reliability to just set and forget. Eventually, I stumbled upon Wireguard, and by stumble, I mean I read so many comments in forums and reddit posts suggesting it that I caved and decided to try it. Initially the setup seemed a bit complicated, but after getting it working I realized that it performed really well. Probably the fastest connection that I was able to get out of any of the solutions that I had tried. I now run a full tunnel on my phone that directs tunnels everything to either my LAN, or through the VPS. This makes sketchy free WiFi a lot safer, and I hardly notice any speed penalty. Now I’m going to go into some of the details of how I got this set up as both a resource for anyone that finds my humble little blog looking for answers, and as documentation for my future self.\nThings needed: A device capable of running Wireguard and doing IP forwarding to other devices on the LAN. A VPS, or a computer somewhere that has a publically routable IP address. Some client to connect from outside the lan, such as a cell phone. ~30 Minutes of your time Setup: The first logical step is to get Wireguard installed on the VPS. In my case I’m using Ubunto 20.04, which has Wireguard support baked into the kernel. If you’re using a different distro, it may be as simple as \u003cpackage manager\u003e install wireguard. If not, consult the Wireguard docs. It’s alwaays a good idea to update your repo sources before installing something. sudo apt update Now you should be good to install the Wireguard package. apt install wireguard Now that we have the package installed, its time to get the server configured. Wireguard stores its config under /etc/wireguard by default. I prefer the vim editor, but nano is another good option if you don’t feel like learning how to use vim. sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf creates a new file under the /etc/wireguard directory, and opens vim to edit the file. In my case, the file looks like this: [Interface] PrivateKey = \u003cyour private key\u003e ListenPort = 51820 Address = 10.0.50.1/24 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE [Peer] PublicKey = \u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs = 10.0.50.2/32 ,10.0.0.0/24, 192.168.0.0/24 Let’s break this down a bit. Everything under [Interface] is describing the interface on the local(to the config file) machine, in this case wg0.\nTo get a private key, you can run wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey \u003e publickey to generate 2 files, publickey and privatekey. The private key should never leave this machine, and it’s content can be pasted into the config file. We will use the public key for the config of the clients later. The listen port is fairly self explanitory, the port that Wireguard is listening on. You can change this for some added security, but that’s arguably more obscurity than security. The address the is the address that the interface (wg0 in this case) will use. Postup is for running a command after the interface comes up. Here we are using some iptables rules to accept incoming and outgoing traffic from the Wireguard interface, and then routing traffic from wg0 to eth0. PostDown is the opposite of PostUp. Here we are deleting the iptables entries after wg0 does down. Everything under [Peer] describes another node on the wireguard network. You can make multiple if you want multiple nodes.\nThe public key can be generated on the peer later, and pasted into here. Now that we have the config mostly set up on the VPS, we can configure the device on the LAN to act as a gateway. Follow steps 1 and 2 again on the LAN device, and generate another keypair on this device. wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey \u003e publickey Edit /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf on this device now, the config should look something like this: [Interface] PrivateKey=\u003cyour private key\u003e Address=10.0.50.2 ListenPort=51820 PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT PostUp = sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT PostDown = sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 [Peer] PublicKey=\u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs=0.0.0.0/0 PersistentKeepalive=25 Endpoint=\u003cvps public IP address\u003e:51820 The public key will be the public key we generated on the VPS AllowedIPs is for which IP address ranges you want to allow to communicate with the interface wg0. You can use a /32 if you only want a single IP, a /24 for a standard network, or really anything including 0.0.0.0/0 if you want to allow all traffic. PersistentKeepAlive keeps the tunnel alive by sending packets as often as you tell it to. 25 seconds seems to be what most people use, and it’s worked well for me Endpoint is the address of the Wireguard server, in this case the VPS. You can use an IP or a dns name here, and make sure to include the port number. Grab the public key from the LAN device, and go paste it into the VPS config under the Peer section. Now we should be able to fire up the interfaces. To do this, run wg-quick up wg0 on both devices. Try sending a ping from one interface to the other, and vice versa. If everything was set up correctly, you should be seeing replies. Ping a device on the LAN from the VPS, that should also work and indicates that the ip forwarding rules worked. If it’s not, check if ip forwarding is enabled on the LAN side with the command sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward. 0 indicates it being disabled, 1 indicates it being enabled. Now you can configure a mobile device. I have an Android phone, and was able to install the Wireguard app from the Play Store. The configuration is pretty straight forward and similar to the other devices. You can even generate a keypair with a button on the mobile app. If you’d like to tunnel all traffic through the VPN, use 0.0.0.0/0 for the allowed IPs. If not, use the subnet for the wireguard itnerface, 10.0.50.0/24, and whichever LAN subnets you want access to. Copy the public key for the [Peer] entry on the VPS which should look like this: [Peer] PublicKey = \u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs = 10.0.50.3/32 9. At this point everything should be working. If you’re having issues, a good place to start is using the tcpdump command, and logically going through the steps of what needs to happen. I had some difficulties the first few times I set this up, but have no issues repeating it now. 10. For bonus points, run PiHole either on the VPS, or somehwere on your LAN, and point to it for DNS on the smartphone config. This will give you always on ad blocking if you use the full tunnel option. I run my phone with the full tunnel on almost 100% of the time, save for the few services that act weird when you use a VPS public IP address(looking at you, Netflix).",

    "content": "June 27th, 2020 My Dad, Jed and I went on this hike with the intention of doing a shakedown overnight trip to test our legs and gear for our upcoming PCT section hike. We arrived at the trail head at 7:30 that morning and started towards the Forni lake trail with plenty of mosquitoes to keep us company. The first leg of the journey was fairly uneventful, I’ve hiked to Forni lake probably a dozen times or so. We made good time to the big Mule’s Ear field, which was just starting to bloom. Jed in the field of Mule’s Ears\nWe made it to the lake not long after, and opted to climb the ridge south of the lake rather than take the trail that leads to Tell’s Peak.\nLooking west from the top of the ridge\nBy 10:30, we were on top of the ridge with a great view of nearby Crystal Range peaks, as well as a sliver of Tahoe(there was a bit of haze that morning, but we could just make it out).\nLooking south toward McConnell peak\nWe hung out for a few minutes, and discussed what looked like the best option to get down to Highland Lake. We decided to go down a drainage just to the right of where we crested the ridge. It was a big slow going at first getting down some large drop offs, but overall not too bad. We made it down to Highland Lake right around lunch time. My dad descending towards Highland Lake\nAt Highland Lake, we were happy to count at least 50 yellow legged frogs in a small area where we ate lunch – a species that was classified as endangered just a few years ago. It seems that the remoteness of this lake has worked to the frog’s advantage. Yellow Legged Frogs\nWe hung out for probably 30-45 minutes, eating lunch and taking a few quick dips into the frigid alpine water. At one point we heard what sounded like thunder, and saw a large sheet of snow get dislodged from the steep granite slabs southwest of the lake. Before long we packed up and started making our way to the next lake.\nMy CalTopo map showed a trail from Highland Lake to Lake Zitella, so we decided to try to find that. After a few hundred yards of walking along what was supposed to be a trail, we realized that the trail was probably long forgotten, and more of a route. We passed a few small lakes that flowed out of Highland, and crossed the drainage a quarter mile or so east of the lake. From there we continued southeast towards a saddle between 2 points that led us to Lake Zitella.\nWe ended up choosing probably the worst possible route up the saddle, going up a very steep creek covered with slippery moss and grass, at one point skirting a small waterfall. the small waterfall\nBefore long though, we were at the top of the saddle looking down at Lake Zitella. Jed looking down towards Zitella Lake\nWe saw some impressive and steep granite slabs to the west of the lake, Desolation continues to impress me with its immense amounts of granite.\nSteep granite slabs above Zitella Lake\nAt Zitella, we stopped again for more snacks and swimming. The water was surprisingly warm compared to Highland lake. At this point we decided it would be good to turn back, since we didn’t have an overnight permit and needed to camp outside the desolation boundary. We found a better route to the east of the saddle, and made our way back down to the Highland Lake drainage. My dad climbing back towards Highland Lake\nWe made much better time getting back down to the Highland drainage, and started the long slog back up. Looking up towards the ridge south of Tells peak was daunting. We had a long steep climb ahead of us. Surprisingly though, the climb wasn’t nearly as bad as any of us expected, and we were back up around 5pm. Looking east towards Highland Lake\nLooking north towards Tell’s Peak\nWe opted to take the Tell’s Peak trail back down to Forni, which was hard to follow but had enough cairns to make it manageable. By 6 we were back at Forni. We made great time from here on, quickly walking down the well beaten trail that we were thankful to be on. Right around the Desolation boundary, the mosquitoes started to get bad. This motivated us to walk faster, and as we descended they got even worse. We ended up continuing to power walk all the way to the cars and were done with our ~17 mile out and back by 7:45. With the amount of mosquitoes out, and being at the cars we elected to call it a day trip. My Dad and I quickly said goodbye to Jed as we fought off hoards of mosquitoes, hopped in the car and headed off.\nThe goal was to see how we fared doing 15 miles with full packs, expecting a small section of cross country travel between the Crystal Range ridge and Highland Lake. However past the ridge it was more or less all cross country. We exceeded our mileage, and in conditions far worse than what could be found anywhere on the PCT. Mission accomplished.",
