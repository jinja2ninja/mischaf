My alarm went off at an ungodly 2AM on this fine Saturday morning. I had 2 parties to go to later that day, the first being at noon. I stubbornly refused to give up on bagging another Ogul this weekend, and Mt Rose seemed to make the most sense given a lot of factors (mostly snow and estimated time to the summit). I rolled out of bed, and made the long sleepy drive up to Mt Rose Summit via highway 80.</description>

I woke up at my campsite near Sonora Pass right around 4:40AM. It was 20 minutes before my alarm, but the desert birds had started their morning routine already. This was my third morning out there, and I knew that this meant the sun was coming up soon. I felt rested so I forced myself out of my down quilt, and started packing my truck up.</description>

I let myself sleep in until around 6 after doing East and Middle Sisters the day before. I figured Desert Creek Peak would be a relatively easy day in comparison. I packed all of my stuff into my truck, and drove down to where I had seen Desert Creek the day before. There ended up being some people camped here, so I decided I&amp;rsquo;d find some other place to park my truck.</description>

I took off work a few hours early at 3PM Friday, and already had mostly loaded my truck up for 3 days of camping. I had a few odds and ends to handle after, but was on the road by 3:30PM or so. I stopped to get gas and a few road snacks in Placerville, and was soon headed up highway 50. Somewhere shortly before Kyburz, it started to rain pretty hard.</description>

My alarm woke me up from a weird dream at 2:40AM. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the specifics of it at this point, but I do recall there being some weird tribal music, kind of similar to the &amp;ldquo;Survivor&amp;rdquo; theme song. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t slept that well, and had a moderately painful lump in my throat the week leading up. Despite my discomfort, I had been dreaming about this peak all week.</description>

I woke up early again for this one, we had enjoyed a nice dip in temps, along with some precipitation the previous week. I even got in a rare May pow day the previous Sunday. Looking at the forecast though, it was pretty clear that this Saturday was set to be significantly hotter. I wanted to knock another OGUL peak off, and initially had planned to go climb Mt Rose.</description>

My goal this winter has simply been to log as many days as possible on my splitboard. It brings me joy regardless of the conditions, a day out splitboarding is a good day. That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been (very) slowly chipping away at the Tahoe Ogul Peak List, and Rubicon was one of the closer ones that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t ticked off yet. In addition, the conditions lined up in a way that the snow would probably still be decent there.</description>

      <description>1/28/2023 This was my second tour of the year. I got a bit of a late start, but I had a busy start of the season dealing with the insane amount of rain I got at home. Thankfully that translates to a huge amount of snow in the mountains. I had enjoyed some awesome, waist deep powder on Waterhouse the weekend before, but I knew that the soft snow was going to be harder and harder to find.</description>

      <description>June 27th, 2020 My Dad, Jed and I went on this hike with the intention of doing a shakedown overnight trip to test our legs and gear for our upcoming PCT section hike. We arrived at the trail head at 7:30 that morning and started towards the Forni lake trail with plenty of mosquitoes to keep us company. The first leg of the journey was fairly uneventful, Iâ€™ve hiked to Forni lake probably a dozen times or so.</description>
