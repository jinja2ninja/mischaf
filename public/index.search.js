I’ve also been known to enjoy cycling, both road and mountain, but have been enjoying being on my feet more lately. I’m currently focused on finishing the Tahoe Ogul Peak List, a list of 63 peaks within a few hours of Tahoe. I have been doing these since before I knew the list existed in 2014. This May, I decided I want to complete it before I turn 30. This should keep me pretty busy on weekends for the next 6-12 months. I plan to document the remaining peaks I have as of May 2023, which is 40.\nOGUL Tracking OGUL #30 - Mt Rose OGUL #29 - Mt Siegel OGUL #28 - Desert Creek Peak OGUL #26 and #27 - East and Middle Sister OGUL #25 - Job's Peak OGUL #24 - Wade Benchmark OGUL #23 - Rubicon Peak Mt Ralston Ridge Desolation Wilderness North Lakes Tour ",

    "content": "June 3rd, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy alarm went off at an ungodly 2AM on this fine Saturday morning. I had 2 parties to go to later that day, the first being at noon. I stubbornly refused to give up on bagging another Ogul this weekend, and Mt Rose seemed to make the most sense given a lot of factors (mostly snow and estimated time to the summit). I rolled out of bed, and made the long sleepy drive up to Mt Rose Summit via highway 80. I’m a big proponent of the alpine start, but what sucks about driving at 2AM is that you can’t see any of the scenery. Regardless, I made it to the trailhead and was walking by 4:48AM. I didn’t have a ton of info on the route, but understood there was a bridge somewhere over Galena Creek, and that I’d just need to aim for the east ridge. Easy stuff on paper.\nA hundred feet or so from leaving the truck, I stumbled upon a BBQ, chairs and a cooler, and not long after, a person sleeping in a hammock. I have no idea if I woke them up or not, but I tried my best not to. From there, I cut down towards the creek to see if I could find the bridge. I never did find it, and ended up bushwhacking my way upstream through thickets of young aspen and soft snow, not terribly fun. I was on the lookout for either the bridge, or a way to get across. Eventually I found a somewhat sketchy but solid looking log to cross. It was a downed aspen, quite wet in places, and had a tangle of branches just strong enough to push me around. I did my best to use the branches to plant my poles on for balance, and survived the crossing without falling in. After that I made my way up the hill a bit, and eventually stumbled upon a faint trail. I followed the trail for a bit, eventually getting to the point where I could see the south facing side of the ridge. It was mostly dried out, and I decided I would ditch my splitboard here. I had brought it as more of a tool than a recreational device, and it appeared I had a good chance to just make it in my trail runners.\nMy sketchy but effective log crossing\nAnother beautiful sierra sunrise\nAfter finding a suitable tree to stash some gear behind, I cut up towards the ridge. Feeling a lot lighter, I started making pretty decent time. I found another use trail and followed that along the side of the ridge, before running into a steep snowfield filling in a small gully. I tested a step on it. and immediately knew that wasn’t going to work well in shoes. I ended up going directly up the steep ridge here, skirting the edge of the ridge. The area where the snowpatch had retreated recently was still held together nicely by moisture. I finally topped out and was on the ridge to find it still had significant snow coverage. There was a thin strip near the edge where I was able to bushwhack a path for a bit without needing to go into the snow.\nLooking down towards my parking spot after gaining the ridge\nI worked my way up, switching between bushwhacking and gingerly walking in the snow with minimal traction, neither option was ideal. After what felt like a while, the ridge came to a rocky high point, which I skirted to the left the best I could, trying to avoid snow. From here I could see the summit, and enjoyed a nice long stretch of snow free travel, even joining up with the summer trail for a bit.\nLight bushwhacking at the edge of the snow\nI had a choice ahead of me: take one last, somewhat steep snowfield to get to the summit ridge, or go to the left and do some class 3 or 4 climbing to avoid it. I decided I’d give the snow a try, and traverse over to the rocks if needed. The snow had sun cups about 6 inches deep, which provided the perfect place to put my feet. It never really got that hard, even in the steeper couple hundred feet towards the top.\nThe summit block\nMidway up the last snowfield\nFrom atop the snowfield. 2 bumps in the ridge lay ahead, the second being the proper summit. I veered left around the first ridge, but ended up going to the top of it anyway because it ended up looking easier to go that way. At that point, I was a few hundred feet from the summit, and made it over there quickly. My goal had been to make it to the top by 8AM, and back to the truck by 10AM. I stood on the summit right at 7:57. The view of Tahoe was beautiful, and I could see quite a few of my most recent peaks I’d climbed, including Mt Siegel from just 5 days earlier. I didn’t find a register, but did see some interesting artifacts of some sort of structure that was there at one point. After taking a few pictures, and a bit of a snack break, I headed back down.\nSummit panorama\nA decent view of Tahoe\nI made great time getting back to the snowfield, going the other way around the bump in the ridge before the summit just to get a fresher view of the area. The snowfield was a fun glissade/butt slide, and I was down it in short order. I power walked the dry patch between that and the next long snowfield, I had a lot of driving and 2 parties to make it to, so I had no time to waste. The long snowfield was a blast to glissade down, my feet got soaked, but I was sliding on and off for a solid mile.\nThe long glissade back down\nAt one point, I saw a black furry creature charging up the ridge towards me. For a moment, I thought it was a bear cub and that things might get a bit sketchy. Thankfully, it was a friendly dog that ran right up with its tail wagging, wanting some attention from me. Not far below was the owner making his way up on snowshoes. I altered my course a bit to stop and talk to the owner. I figured we could swap info on the route. He ended up being grumpy and not wanting to talk aside from some one word responses and grunts. In retrospect, he was probably jealous to see such a strapping young lad already on his way down at such an early hour. With no time to waste on the old grouch, I continued sliding my way down the ridge, having a great time, barely in control at times.\nMore snow to descend\nOnce I got near the bottom of the ridge, I started checking my CalTopo app to see where I’d need to cut down to fetch my gear. I took a slightly different path, but found the use trail eventually and was soon at my gear, which was just as I’d left it. I quickly loaded up the heavy burden that I didn’t need to bring, and begrudgingly carried on. The skis were at an awkward angle, making my poles bump into the bottoms. I got back onto the use trail, and enjoyed my last bit of easy walking before the bushwhack ahead.\nMy gear right where I left it\nI found the bushwhack to be more aggravating being fully awake, and with softer snow. I was punching through a lot more, but trying my best to still make good time. My 10AM deadline was looking tighter by the moment. I found the log crossing, and once again made the sketchy walk across the slippery Aspen. After crossing, I had about a quarter mile of thick Aspen and soft snow. Thankfully I had the advantage of daylight this time, so I was able to at least see ahead a bit. After some thrashing about, I started hearing music in the distance and figured it must be someone on the highway. As I got closer, I recognized the song as “The Spins” by Mac Miller, one of my favorites from senior year of high school. The music ended up being the people camped out, who were now fully awake and enjoying the day. I waved as I passed by their camp, and was at the truck right at 9:56AM with wet feet, but otherwise feeling great.\nRoute GPX Track Download\n",

    "content": "May 29th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI woke up at my campsite near Sonora Pass right around 4:40AM. It was 20 minutes before my alarm, but the desert birds had started their morning routine already. This was my third morning out there, and I knew that this meant the sun was coming up soon. I felt rested so I forced myself out of my down quilt, and started packing my truck up. I quickly broke camp and threw everything in my truck, on the road towards Gardnerville shortly after 5. The drive went by quickly, and I went straight to the Walmart there to grab some food for my excursion.\nAfter leaving Walmart, I headed down Lone Pine Canyon Road, figuring I’d go as far as I felt comfortable going with my truck. There are various reports on this road on peakbagger.com, with varying accounts of how difficult the road is. One person suggested airing down your tires a few miles in (not really an option without a compressor), and others claimed to have made it to the Galena Saddle, just shy of the peak in stock 4runners and Tacomas. The road was just a normal dirt road for the first few miles. but around the area where the person suggested airing down it had a ton of rocks on the road. I understood why he suggested that, but wasn’t too worried about my tires yet. I made one fairly deep creek crossing, and encountered some pretty deep mud and ruts along the next few miles. At one point, I bottomed my truck out on a big rock, which made me wince pretty hard. I got out and checked the underside of my truck, and nothing seemed damaged, so I kept going. Eventually the mud got more consistent, as well as the deep ruts that required you to straddle to avoid getting stuck. I told myself I’d use the next good pullout to park and just walk from there. The road not long after I parked\nI found a good place to park, and got my stuff ready to go. My plan was to hit this fast and light, I wanted to get done early so I could make it down Highway 50 before too much Memorial Day traffic formed near Meyers as it often does. The parking spot was somewhere around 1.5 miles from the start of the ridge that leads up to Mt Siegel that I planned to take up. This section of road was easy enough to walk, but I was glad to have left my truck behind. There were a few spots where I had to jump across sections of water in the road, and for a few hundred feet the road became more of a creek. Near the ridge, some very deep ruts had formed that I would definitely not have wanted to attempt in my truck.\nMt Siegel’s Ridge\nBefore too long, I started cutting up from the road to the ridge, immediately soaking my feet in the dew-covered tall grass. There was a pretty significant fire here a few years back, so there was a mix of dead trees and a fairly vibrant selection of shrubs, grasses and flowers. A part of me is always bummed to see an area burned so badly, but its also reassuring to see how quickly things restore. Fire is after all just part of the cycle in places like this. I’m sure this was neither the first nor last fire in this area. Wet grass on the bottom of the ridge\nAfter a light bushwhack, I started up the beginning of the ridge proper. This was one of the steepest sections of the ridge all day, mostly medium sized light colored granite with tree carcasses and shrubs among it. The climb would consist of many sections of steeper ridge leading to brief sections where it flattened out. I put my focus on making it up the first such section and was there before too long. The view from up there was pretty nice towards Job’s Peak from the previous weekend. Job’s Peak in the distance\nFrom here, the angle was a bit lighter for a good distance before the next high point on the ridge, and the ratio of vegetation to rock started to lean more in favor of rock. I kept moving pretty consistently here, stopping occasionally to snap a picture and catch my breath. The weather was overcast which I was grateful for, this peak must be brutal in the heat of summer with direct sunlight. Looking back I could clearly see where the fire had stopped, creating a stark contrast between the green forest and the recovering shrubs. My route followed the ridge up to point 8595, and I stopped again for a quick snack break and to check my progress on the map. Looking up from near point 8595\nMaking it to the next bump in the ridge looked like it would require crossing at least a small section of snow, so I tried to aim for the shortest possible crossing. The climb up to this point started to feel a lot more alpine. The chunks of granite became generally a lot larger and the slope was steeper. That said, I found the larger pieces of granite to be more stable and easier to hop across, this is one of my favorite types of terrain to travel through. I managed to find about the shortest section of snow possible to cross, and was soon on point 9354, just a few hundred vertical feet below Siegel, but with a decent distance left.\nSome interesting bones, perhaps a cougar or a beaver?\nThe rest of the journey from here didn’t look too bad, I’d lose a trivial amount of elevation, cross a fairly large saddle, and then make the final push to the summit. I set off, making great time on some of the easier terrain of the day. A few times, I stopped when I noticed cool looking bones on the ground. I’ve seen my fair share of bones, but never so many so close to each other as Mt Siegel. The summit was now fully socked in with fog, giving it a pretty cool look. It didn’t really feel like I was in Nevada at this point with the way things looked.\nThe last stretch towards the summit\nBefore long, I was at the last climb up towards the summit, and made it up quickly. I realized that I was closing in on 3 hours since I had started, and this arbitrary time limit made me move more quickly. There is a pile of rocks just north of the true summit that I felt might be higher, so I went up that just to be sure, before heading over to the large summit cairn. I summited at 10:13AM, about 2 hours and 52 minutes after leaving the truck. I snapped some pictures, signed the register, and transferred some gatorade into the bottle that I carry on my shoulder strap for the way down. After a few minutes of snacking and enjoying the view, I began my descent.\nSummit panorama\nThe descent proved to be pretty quick and easy by comparison. I opted to go east around point 9354, although I ended up having to cross a larger snowfield so that may not have been all that much more efficient. Once I cleared the larger granite, I was able to veer more to the east and pick up the pace significantly through more sandy soil, even jogging for sections where I could. I passed point 8595 in the same fashion, and made a great time down to the last point before the road. From here, I was forced to slow down a bit as there was a ton of downed trees and thicker brush. I started hearing engines down below me, and saw a truck emerging from the woods near where I had cut up to the ridge. The truck did not seem to be making much progress, so I went directly towards it just in case they were stuck and might need help.\nI enjoyed a bit of glissading on the way down\nLooking back down the ridge, the line of the fire is stark\nI got down to the road and found that it was actually a group of 4 or 5 off roaders, slowly making their way through some very deep ruts and mud. We talked for a minute or 2, and I gave them what info I could about what lay ahead for them. They too were heading up Mt Siegel, although they intended to drive to the top. The rest of the road was fairly uneventful from there. The sun came out a bit more than before, although I never really felt hot. As I got closer, the 5 hour round trip marker started to creep up, and I again had an arbitrary time to beat. I hustled down the road and made it to the truck right at 4 hours 53 minutes.\nWashed out road on the way back to the truck\nRoute GPX Track Download\n",

    "content": "May 28th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI let myself sleep in until around 6 after doing East and Middle Sisters the day before. I figured Desert Creek Peak would be a relatively easy day in comparison. I packed all of my stuff into my truck, and drove down to where I had seen Desert Creek the day before. There ended up being some people camped here, so I decided I’d find some other place to park my truck. I had seen a side spur road about a mile south on my topo map, so decided to check that out. This road was near the base of Black Mountain, and I figured I could link the ridges between the 2 up. I had read a Bob Burd trip report about him doing both, but my memories were pretty fuzzy about the details. I didn’t have any service so I figured I’d just use my topo maps and wing it. I made it a decent ways up the spur road, and found a nice place to park my truck for the day. This was well off the beaten path, so I was pretty confident nobody would mess with my stuff. I loaded my day pack up, and was off shortly on my way.\nThere was no trail, but the route was fairly obvious. I aimed between 2 small bumps below Black Mountain, and hung a left(heading north) once I got between them. Up until this point, I was just walking through nice evenly spaced Pinyon Pines with the occasional bit of Sage here or there. After hanging the left, I was faced with a big thicket of Mountain Mahogany, which had been the hardest part of the day before coming down East Sister.I made my way through this, aiming for the ridge of Black Mountain ahead. After the thicket, I went downhill a short way to a fairly clear opening that led up the the slope of the mountain.\nSome Lupine early into the walk\nI made my way up northwest, on something that felt somewhat like a ridge, but with a decent amount of trees obscuring most of the views. The bushwhacking wasn’t terrible for the most part, mostly Pinyon Pines which seem to dominate the area they grow in, and are relatively easy to walk through. Once I made it to the proper ridge leading to the summit, things got worse. I had to crawl through some sections of really thick brush on my hands and knees. Before long though, I had found the somewhat ambiguous summit, marked by a small pile of rocks. I was a bit disappointed (but not surprised) that there was no register here. I looked through the pile of rocks to no avail. After snapping some pictures and soaking in the (actually decent) view, I continued along the ridge to the northeast.\nBushwhacking conditions near the top of Black Mountain\nThe pile of rocks marking the summit\nBlack Mountain Summit panorama\nThe ridge was more of a bushwhack, but I didn’t find it to be that bad. Sticking either on the ridge, or just slightly on the leeward side seemed to be the play here. The rocks made somewhat of a path that was manageable, below the ridge on either side looked quite a bit harder. I passed a few cool volcanic features with some easy 3rd class scrambling near the bottom of the ridge. Eventually the ridge opened up into a nice open area of low sage that was about a quarter mile long. It was a nice break from the bushwhacking, but I could see more coming not far ahead. I was soon back in the thicket going uphill for another 300 vertical feet or so before coming to another opening, now facing directly towards the ridge leading to Desert Creek Peak, the true prize of the day. I stopped here and ate some of my sandwich and compared my topo maps to what I could see with my eyes. It seemed that the easiest path forward would be to drop down a few hundred feet to the northeast, and then try to link up a somewhat continuous line of less dense vegetation.\nDesert Creek Peak to the north\nThe rocky ridge coming down Black Mountain\nThe clearing where I stopped for a break\nI decided to go with my plan, and dropped down through more low Sage. I was soon on what was clearly a game trail, I saw a ton of deer droppings along this for a good distance, before veering back uphill to the northwest. I had spotted a pretty distinct rock about half way up the mountain from the field of sage that I was able to use to orient myself on the lower part of the slope. Eventually though, I was in the thick of things again nearing the top of the ridge and just had to rely on a general sense of direction and the path of least resistance. As with the ridge before, I once again found there to be some relatively easy travel just below the ridge on the leeward side. I continued forcing my will upon the thick brush before finally making it to the ridge proper where I found a decent path among the rocks.\nThe view from midway up the bushwhack to the ridge\nLooking south towards the Sisters from the ridge\nAt this point I was getting pretty close to the summit, although there was one last bump on the ridge to overcome. I came across a fairly long patch of snow that I was happy to find still firm enough to support my weight, and happily walked across it. Even short sections of open walking made me quite happy that day compared to the effort that some other sections required to just make it the next few feet. I came to the top of the last bump, and could see the the communication tower on the summit not far in the distance. I knew that the regular route came through this area, and tried my best to find it on the west side of the ridge. As I later learned reading some trip reports, there isn’t really an actual trail, more of just a path of least resistance up the thing. The last bit of the way up to the summit stuck to the days theme, and was a fight against Mountain Mahogany to the bitter end.\nI found a surprising amount of infrastructure at the summit, including a concrete footing that seemed to never get used, a large electrical enclosure (dated 1960), the communication tower, and various other odds and ends. I’m not entirely sure what the tower is for, but there is a California Department of Transportation marker at the summit, perhaps its used by CalTrans for radio communications? There are 2 thick black cords of some sort leading from the tower. They seemed easily thick enough to easily carry enough current to kill me, and the outer sheath was clearly compromised in quite a few places, so I stayed away from them. There was a large cairn on the summit, but unfortunately no register to be found. I hung out at the top for 15-20 minutes eating more of my sandwich and trying to formulate a plan for the way down.\nDesert Creek Peak summit panorama\nThe summit cairn\nCommunication tower at the summit, I’m not convinced it’s still operational\nI was faced with 2 options: take the normal route down, and have to deal with crossing the raging Desert Creek on the road multiple times, or try to bushwhack the ridge back a bit and then cut down south of the crossings, and take the road from there. I chose to take the ridge back as it seemed like a more novel route than most of the trip reports I had read, and that seemed to be a theme that day. Staying higher on the ridge than when I came up ended up working out quit well, there was a lot more rock up there to prevent brush from growing. I still had some hard sections, and had to army crawl through Mountain mahogany more than once, but it worked out pretty well and I was able to move a lot faster than my ascent. I played a Leon Bridges album from my phone speaker to get me through the bushwhack, which really lifted my spirits.\nLooking back up towards the summit\nWhat most of the ridge looked like\nI moved up and down the ridge until I got to the high point at around 8500 feet. From here, I started to make my way down to the southwest among some nicely spaced Pinion Pines. This was quite steep and loose, but open enough for me to do a light jog down a lot of it. This section flew by, and before long I was near what looked like a road on my topo map. I met up with the “road” near the bottom of the canyon, and found it to really be more of a ridiculously steep trail, I’m really not sure what type of vehicle could make it up. Right before the road, I found an area with a bunch of Obsidian flakes. I’m not sure if these were naturally occurring, or a relic from Native Americans, but they were cool to see either way.\nThings opening up down lower\nOne of many obsidian flakes I saw in a small area\nEnjoying a nice rest at Desert Creek\nWalking back up the road\nAt the bottom of the steep trail, I popped out onto the road, right across from where a group of people were camped. 3 dogs came charging at me, but their owner called them back, and they didn’t seem too aggressive. The owner apologized, and I continued down the road. Not far up from there was the spot I had planned to park at originally, which was now vacant. I stopped here for another 10-15 minutes and ate the rest of my lunch after dipping my feet in the water. From here it was another 1.5 miles or so back up the road, which was quite pleasant compared to what I had just been through. My truck was waiting for me just as I had left it on the lonely little side road. I was running low on clean water, and decided to pack up and head into Bridgeport to get more. This would put me a bit closer to my next day’s objective depending on where I camped. I ended up finding a nice spot right near the Sonora Pass junction, and enjoyed a nice early bedtime that night.\nRoute GPX Track Download\n",

    "content": "May 27th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI took off work a few hours early at 3PM Friday, and already had mostly loaded my truck up for 3 days of camping. I had a few odds and ends to handle after, but was on the road by 3:30PM or so. I stopped to get gas and a few road snacks in Placerville, and was soon headed up highway 50. Somewhere shortly before Kyburz, it started to rain pretty hard. I stopped at the Silverfork store and moved a few things from my truck bed that weren’t waterproof into the cab. I made a quick stop in Gardnerville for some Jack in the Box Tacos, and then headed down 395.\nShortly before Topaz Lake, I took a left onto highway 208 for the first time, having continued south every other time I’ve driven by. The rain was still coming down here, but not nearly as hard, it was more of a sprinkle. Before I knew it, 208 turned into 338 and I was heading south. Highway 338 reminded me a lot of 395 to the west, just with slightly different scenery. The mountains of Nevada were drying out, but most were still capped with some snow. Not long after I made it to Risue Road, which led to my campsite. Risue Road is pretty nice for a dirt forest service road, but there were a few mud crossings in the first half mile or so that I wouldn’t have wanted to try in a passenger car.\nI followed Risue road for a few miles, and soon opened my CalTopo app to get an idea of where the side road I wanted to take was. I turned onto the side road, and was greeted with some pretty thick brush on either side of the road that added some nice pinstripes to my truck. It kind of makes me cringe, but I didn’t get my truck to look pretty. The road didn’t go on for too long, and I was at the corral I had read about online soon. I had thought based on maps that there was perhaps a possibility of going further than the corral, but the road was completely overgrown and perhaps only 3 feet wide beyond there. I parked my truck and set up my tent in a light rain, and took a few minutes to walk around the area to check it out. It had a very cool rustic feel to it. I stayed up long enough to see the sun start to set, and was in bed before 9PM.\nSunset by the Corral\nSunrise by the Corral\nI got up the next morning around 5, and had my stuff packed for the day and was ready to go by 5:45. The sunrise over the valley was pretty spectacular. I set off up the road, and it opened up more after a few hundred feet. Not that it would have mattered, the ruts were deeper than I’d want to risk in my stock Frontier. I walked perhaps a half mile up the road before deciding to cut straight up to the ridge. This was fairly steep, but not too difficult.\nThe brief section of road I walked\nThe start of the ridge\nLooking back towards my campsite\nAfter 20 minutes or so, I made it to the first bench on the ridge where I could see the mountain above me better. It seemed like I could see the summit, and that it wasn’t all that far away. I was wrong, the ridge ended up having quite a few false summits. I made it to the the top of this one around 7:30, sticking to the west side to stay out of the snow. I was greeted with a higher point I’d need to go around or over that still wasn’t the summit.\nThe view up towards the false summit\nSome wildflowers I saw around 9000 feet on the ridge\nI opted to go around it the best it could staying to the west to avoid a large snowfield. From there, the ridge veered to the east, but I could see that it just dropped back down and continued along towards the true summit. I decided to try to maintain my current elevation and stick to the west side. This involved a bit of scrambling, and some loose talus in places, but seemed to save me some effort in the long run. On the still shady west side, the rain from the previous night seemed to have frozen, which made the granite slick, and definitely slowed me down a bit. Thankfully my patience paid off, and I didn’t end up slipping and getting injured.\nI soon came to the final section of the ridge up to the true summit, and had to make a choice about how to get around the snowfield with minimal contact with it. I had my ice axe and crampons with me just in case, but didn’t feel like using them. I managed to find the thinnest section of the snowfield, and carefully crossed it to the west. Much care was needed here, I had to gingerly kick each step, sometimes using my poles to help carve out a place for my foot. The snow was still surprisingly firm over here as the sun had not yet hit a lot of it. There was a dry patch followed by one more finger of snow to cross. After those, I was a short distance from the summit.\nLooking towards the actual summit\nThe patch of snow I had to cross\nThe last finger of snow blocking my progress\nThe rest of the climb from here was easy, just hopping up medium sized granite, and soon I was on top of East Sister. The view was pretty nice, and I made the first entry in the register since June of 2022. Apparently this isn’t a very popular mountain. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes enjoying the view and a small snack before continuing along the ridge towards Middle Sister. I had read that it was a bushwhack on the side I was coming down, but bushwhacks are always easier downhill, so I was glad to have that on my side. I spent a minute or 2 where the rock met the bushes, and decided on a path down.\nSummit Panorama\nLooking towards my next objective, Middle Sister\nThe bushwhack down East Sister\nI ended up veering more to the west, finding the best path I could through the thick mountain mahogany. This wasn’t terrible, but wasn’t very glamorous either. The best sections were perhaps 50 feet of clear walking, only to be back at the edge of a thicket, trying to decide the best path forward. Eventually though, I was through it and at the low point between the 2 peaks. Looking back up, there would be more patches of snow to avoid.\nLooking back up the bushwhack I had just come down\nI once again stuck to the west side, and was able to see a set of tracks(most likely a coyote or small mountain lion) heading up in about the same direction as me. I picked up the tracks several times over perhaps a quarter mile, eventually seeing them lead off to the east. Soon I came to another high point in the ridge, accompanied by another snow patch I’d have to circumvent. This one had a big weakness in it that I could easily spot. I worked my way up the west side of the ridge, staying a bit lower than the top of it. Just shy of one of the last bumps before the summit, I veered further west to get through the narrowest section of snow. I only ended up needing to take a few steps through snow to avoid this one.\nTracks in the snow\nAt this point I was about 4 or 5 hundred vertical feet from the summit, and just started going straight up as quickly as I could. Some ominous dark clouds were rolling in from the west, making me a tiny bit worried about thunderstorms. The forecast had looked clear the day before, but I’ve spent enough time on ridges above 10,000 feet to not put much faith in forecasts. With a bit more rock hopping, I was on the summit ridge, and on the summit of Middle Sister in short order. The last push up to the summit\nI stopped at the top to snap some pictures, and let my wife know I had made it. I was feeling on top of the world, until I opened the register and found a very strange and creepy photo. The photo was of a very dirty bathroom with torn up and stained wallpaper. The bathtub was full of some off white liquid, and a man was in it. Next to the bathtub was an older looking lady. Both of them were staring ominously at the camera, and there was a rope on the ground next to the tub. This seriously creeped me out, and took a minute or 2 to shake the feeling. I signed the register, and put the photo back face down in the box. I also found a small tree spider in the register that was somehow still alive. I let the spider out and tried to think about other things.\nMiddle Sister summit Panorama\nSouth Sister\nStrange photo from the register\nAfter doing my best to clear my mind of the weird ass photo, I relaxed and enjoyed my roast beef sandwich and some chips. I probably hung out for 20-30 minutes before deciding it was time to head down. I took the same route more or less down to the low point between Middle and East Sisters. From here, I decided to drop down west to the dirt road down in the valley. I didn’t want to repeat the bushwhack up East Sister, and the valley looked like a nice place to walk back. I dropped down off the ridge here, heading southwest. Looking down to the valley with the road\nI had scoped out the route with the least bushwhacking down there, and did pretty well. The worst of the brush I had to go through was just low sage n o higher than my knees. I aimed for a small volcanic knob where I would have to decide between a snow field (and saving some elevation), and dropping down a few hundred feet to connect with the road sooner. I chose to drop down, and wrapped around the volcanic knob. As I wrapped around, I kept seeing snow on the road, so I decided to just remain uphill. This continued until I reached what looked like the last few patches of snow on the road.\nNear the low point between East and Middle Sisters\nA little volcanic knob below the ridge\nEast and Middle Sisters\nA use trail leading straight down to the road, I didn’t end up taking this\nThe last major snow was a very large drift at the top of a hill that split east from west. I did some small glissading down this to finally make it down to the road. The drift was probably 15 feet high at its tallest point. This was a few thousand feet lower than the mountains I had just climbed, but by far the deepest snow I’d seen all day. The road was more or less a creek for a few hundred yards, so I walked alongside it just out of the reach of the water.The road dried out quickly, and I was soon enjoying the easiest miles of the day. It cut through the valley below East Sister, and I could see about where I had started from. In hindsight, taking the road up a bit higher may have been an easier ascent.\nThe towering snowdrift\nThe road quickly turned pretty rocky again, and passed through an area with a large pile of rocks held together by wire fencing. I’m sure there is some purpose for this pile of rocks, but it wasn’t clear to me. I continued down the road into a more forested section, and soon passed where I had cut up from the road that morning. The last section of the road flew by, and I was back at my truck before I knew it.\nCage of rocks\nI took my shoes off, and sat in my camping chair for a solid 10 minutes just looking up at East Sister. It was only about 2PM, so I had to decide what to do with the rest of my day. I ended up packing up my camp, and driving around the area a bit to get some intel for Desert Creek Peak the next day. I made it down to Desert Creek, and decided to turn my truck around after seeing how much water it had in it. The road crosses it 4 or 5 times to get to the regular route, so I decided against that. On my way back up the road, I decided to pull off on a random side road, and took that a mile or so to another side road where I found a nice place to camp for the night, complete with a great view of East and Middle Sisters.\nThe sisters from my campsite\nRoute Route is approximate, I didn’t record a proper GPX track GPX Track Download\n",

    "content": "May 20th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nMy alarm woke me up from a weird dream at 2:40AM. I can’t recall the specifics of it at this point, but I do recall there being some weird tribal music, kind of similar to the “Survivor” theme song. I hadn’t slept that well, and had a moderately painful lump in my throat the week leading up. Despite my discomfort, I had been dreaming about this peak all week. I did my morning routine as quietly as possible, and left my comfortable bed, wife and dog behind. I love them dearly, but this is more than they want to do in a day.\nI made a quick stop at Speedway in Placerville, and the 3AM tweakers were as active as they ever are. I grabbed a red bull, and some mini chocolate donuts to get my day started. I jammed up highway 50, and was at the trailhead around 4:40. After testing out the snow conditions and getting my gear ready, I was on the trail at 4:50. The trailhead was dry, but the snow started just a few feet behind the locked gate. I had my skis in an a-frame attached to my backpack, and opted to walk in my trail runners for as long as I could before switching over. I was a bit worried as the overnight temps were pretty high the night before, but I found the snow to still be supportive enough for walking.\nBefore long, I started to see the sun rise, and was able to take my headlamp off after about half an hour. I was able to maintain a pace of just above 2 miles per hour comfortably. The only complaint I had was that my splitboard setup was pretty heavy and seemed to be digging into my shoulders more than it usually does. I tried adjusting my backpack quite a few times to address this, but nothing seemed to fix it. For another hour or so, I was able to keep the same pace up with minimal post holing in the snow.\nStarting to see the sun\nThe route follows Willow Creek Road up Horse Canyon, and once the road started getting closer to the creek, the snow seemed to firm up even more. This was great, but I did end up finding a few sections of road that required me to side hill in slippery snow due to the way it had melted more on one side than the other. I did end up losing the route at one point where there was a fairly large opening, I had to check my map several times, and ultimately corrected it within about 20 minutes and got back on the road. Grove of aspens a mile or 2 in\nAnother healthy looking forest in Horse Canyon\nLooking up towards Freel Peak, El Dorado County’s highpoint\nBefore I knew it, I had knocked out nearly 5 miles, and the road had ended. At this point I tried my best to start following the summer trail up Job’s. This was quite a bit steeper than the road, but I was still finding my shoes to do the job. The snow got softer as I went up, and my feet and socks were already fairly wet at this point (I always carry 2 pairs for this reason). I just resigned to a bit more postholing, and continued up with moderately cold feet. I veered a bit off of the summer trail, but its not like there’s much difference when its all snow covered. The trees started to get more alpine looking and windswept as I continued my way up. Eventually, the last saddle below Job’s started to come into view. Looking back down the slope towards Horse Canyon\nI was still about a half mile away when the snow started forming a very slick crust on top. I was able to kick steps in most of the time, but eventually the shady spots became too difficult to kick into, and I started slipping. I found a nice tree to sit next to, and swapped into dry socks and my ski boots. It felt good to have the weight of the boots off of my back, but I immediately felt the strain of the added weight on my feet. This stretch was by far the most exhausting part of the day, my legs just did not want to be swinging my heavy ski boots up the steepish slope. I settled into my slower pace, and before too long, I started to see the snow disappear near the top of the ridge and give way to decomposed granite. This was arguably harder than the snow, but only lasted for a hundred yards or so.\nI still couldn’t quite see the peak from here, but after rounding a corner, it came into view, along with a lot of the Carson Valley. I took my phone out of airplane mode, and sent a quick text to my wife as I sat down and switched back over to wet socks and trail runners. The summer trail to the peak was mostly dry from here, save for one large snowfield that looked manageable in shoes. I left as much gear behind a possible to lighten my load, including the splitboard setup and my larger water bottle. The snowfield crossing was manageable, but the postholing was atrocious. Some steps I hardly punched through, and others were thigh deep. I despise spring post holing, its extremely frustrating and can definitely be dangerous. Regardless, I persevered and made it across the snowfield pretty quick, opting to gain some elevation so I could rock hop near the end. The summit coming into view\nNearing the summit triangle\nFrom here, I was about 300 vertical feet shy of the summit on a dry trail. I made relatively quick work of it, although I was definitely getting pretty gassed from the miles and altitude. The trail snaked along the side of the summit triangle, and as I got closer, I wasn’t quite sure which part was the summit as there were 2 distinct rock outcroppings near the top. As it turned out, the summit was to my right, and that became obvious as I came between the 2 points. The scramble to the very top wasn’t nearly as long as I had anticipated, and I topped out right at 10AM. Panorama from the top\nJob’s Sister and Freel Peak, another fantastic hike in the area\nI took a handful of pictures, and texted my wife from the top in addition to just soaking in the views. The roast beef sandwich I packed was absolutely delicious, and went great with some cheddar Sun Chips. I probably spent 20-30 minutes on top enjoying a hard earned lunch with a fantastic view. It was pretty cool looking down at the Wade Benchmark I had climbed the week before, along with all of the growing list of peaks in the area I can recognize. I still had a long trip back, and the snow was softening up quickly, so I decided to head back down.\nLunch with a view\nThe return trip across the snowfield was a bit easier as I was able to just reuse the steps I had made before. The places where I had postholed deep were definitely a pain to step over though. I made it back to my gear I had dropped, and once again switched back into dry socks and ski boots. After putting my splitboard together, and packing up my gear, I made the brief walk down the decomposed granite to the snow.\nThe snow was very soft, and it was more of survival boarding through the trees than anything glamorous or fast. I still had a good time, and was back down in the valley in short order. Down there, I started hearing the sound of 2 strong engines, and figured there must have been some snowmobilers in the area. After switching over to skis, the snowmobilers got closer and I saw them ripping through the trees. One stopped and we exchanged a quick wave, I was glad they were at least aware of my presence. I skied down through some trees, and soon was back on the road. It was baking hot down there, and I started needing to drink a lot more water. Looking back at Job from Horse Canyon\nThe next few miles were relatively uneventful, but I did start to notice I was running low on water. I saw a creek crossing not far ahead on the map, so held off until then. At the crossing, I realized I was on top of a wooden bridge (perhaps 6 feet above it on snow though), I had missed this when I lost the road that morning. I took my skis off, and brought my water bottle down to the creek. While trying to find a good way down to the snow, I broke off a big chunk of snow, and fell into the creek about knee deep. At least you know its an adventure when things start going wrong! In addition, I realized I didn’t have a filter, and the water had a bit more particulate than I cared for. It was all snowmelt, and the particulate was probably just forest duff that the creek picked up, but I was not stoked to drink it. I grabbed my spare base layer shirt from my backpack, and used that as a “filter” as I drank it for the rest of the trip. Thankfully my boots were wet, but it wasn’t cold enough for me to be concerned. The spot where I punched through into the creek\nAfter leaving the creek, I made a wrong turn and somehow almost took the wrong drainage all the way down to hope valley, several miles below where I was parked. Realizing my mistake, I had to trudge back uphill for about a quarter mile. I had made it this far without using skins, and really didn’t want to put them on now. So I made extra switchbacks, and the slushy snow somehow allowed me to barely eek out some uphill travel without skins. Eventually I got back on the road, and enjoyed being able to glide back down to the car with minimal stops. Down towards the bottom, it got a bit patchy, but I made it back to the car around 1:30PM. I was wet and tired, but beyond happy to see the car. All told, it was about a 15 mile round trip. Right as I made it to the car, I started hearing the first thunder I heard all day, perfect timing.

    "content": "May 13th, 2023 Full Image Gallery\nI woke up early again for this one, we had enjoyed a nice dip in temps, along with some precipitation the previous week. I even got in a rare May pow day the previous Sunday. Looking at the forecast though, it was pretty clear that this Saturday was set to be significantly hotter. I wanted to knock another OGUL peak off, and initially had planned to go climb Mt Rose. I left the house around 3:15AM, and while driving over Echo Summit got the idea to knock Wade off instead of Rose, and save the hour of driving. I wasn’t entirely sure that the trailhead would be thawed out, but I had a feeling it likely would be.\nSure enough, when I got there the parking area was well thawed out. I parked the truck, strapped my skis in an a frame on my backpack, and set out to find the trailhead in the dark, it was around 5:15AM. I found the trail after a few minutes of stumbling around in the dark, and was soon making my way up some steep switchbacks. The trail immediately felt more like the Eastern Sierra than the Tahoe area. It was steep and rocky with plants that reminded me more of the desert than what you typically see in Tahoe. The switchbacks didn’t last too long, and soon they opened up into a route that goes directly up Horsethief Canyon. According to some research, it got its name because of the “horse thieves” who would steal horses from emigrants in Woodfords Canyon, and take them up Horsethief canyon to graze its meadows. The rocky switchbacks near the start\nThe trail along the canyon was fairly steep, and soon crossed through a small grove of aspens. Not long after this, patches of snow started showing up. I was hiking in my crocs, and was pretty stubborn about not wanting to put my ski boots on yet. I took this a bit too far, and soon the trail was more snow than dry patches. My crocs did pretty well, but I started slipping more and more. I pushed this a bit farther than I really should have, and finally decided to acquiesce near the top of the steeper part of the canyon about a mile in. A cool volcanic feature and Hawkins Peak in the distance\nAfter putting on my ski boots, I was able to make much better time than in my crocs. The snow was firm, so I was happy to just walk along in my boots for as long as I could before switching to skinning. The route grew a lot more mellow, and I continued along through some really nice old looking Ponderosa and Logdepole pines. Clearly this area has managed to avoid the logging that has taken place in most of California that’s accessible by vehicles. People say that logging prevents wildfires, but when you compare old growth to second growth, I think that argument falls flat on its face. A large Ponderosa(?) Pine after the canyon flattened out\nI continued along the west side of the creek through the woods for about 3/4 of a mile. After that, I crossed the creek near where I saw a road on my topo map and started making my way up a long ridge. The ridge had some monster Juniper trees, which are some of my favorite trees. They just seem wise to me for some reason, they’re never the tallest, but they can be stout. Somewhere around ~8200 feet, the grove of Junipers eventually gave way to a long, low angled opening that continued up towards the top. The snow here was still surprisingly smooth, and I started to realize that I might actually get some good turns in. I had resigned to this just being a long walk through the woods, but I’ll always take good snow if its available. Junipers on the east slope of the canyon\nAfter perhaps an hour, I topped out on the ridge around 9200 feet, and finally decided it was time to switch to skinning as the snow on top was getting softer. Once I started skinning, I realized I started debating whether or not it would have been more efficient to have switched over sooner. Regardless, I was making good time across the relatively flat ridge top. Even though Wade was less than 200 vertical feet higher, I still had about 1.2 miles to go. This was fine with me, as the views from the area were incredible, and I had the whole place to myself. The gentle open face leading up the ridge\nLooking back towards Carson Pass from ~9000ft\nAfter a bit, I went under a really cool looking volcanic rock feature, the whole day really felt more like I was in the southwest than the Tahoe area. Not too far beyond that, Wade came into view, and I saw that there would be a bit of a downhill to get to Wade. I came up to a cornice that was about 10’ tall, and managed to side slip down it with my skis, and did my best to stay on the highest point possible connecting the 2 points. Before long, I was at the base of the summit block of Wade. I dropped my skis here, and made a short bushwhack/rock scramble to the top. Another cool volcanic feature\nThe views from the top were spectacular. I could see the whole Carson pass area pretty well, down into Gardnerville, northeast towards the Freel-Job’s ridge, and the Ebett’s pass area to the south. I signed the register, and was surprised to see nobody had signed it since October of last year. There was another older register box, and unfortunately the contents were mostly ruined by water. However, I did see a signature from 1989 which was pretty cool. I hung out for perhaps 10-15 minutes, and started making my way back down. Once I got back to my skis, it was pretty smoooth sailing back to the top of the ridge I had ascended that morning. I stopped here for a good 20 minutes to take my ski boots off for a few minutes and enjoy a nice snack break. Panorama from the top of Wade\nWhat remains of the old register\nAfter eating, I transitioned my splitboard and took off down the ridge. I knew it was really easy going terrain, so I had opted to leave my helmet this time. Of course that meant I forgot to take off my hat, which flew off within 15 seconds or so of starting off on my snowboard. I made the annoying hike back up to go grab it, and then set off again. The corn was perfect, and I enjoyed some awesome, wide open turns for a bit, before coming to a wall of trees a lot sooner than expected. I checked the map, and I had veered a bit in the wrong direction, and was going down a different drainage. I unstrapped, and hiked across the slope back towards the way I came up (perhaps a few hundred yards at most). The snow was still perfect over here, and I flew down about a mile in just a few minutes.\nMellow turns back down to the creek\nI crossed the creek a bit southeast of where I had crossed in the morning, but still had no issues. I put my headphones in, and listened to a podcast as I worked my way back through the forest. After about an hour, I was back at the top of the Canyon. I was a bit higher than my approach, so I had to walk down some fairly steep dirt. On my way down, I found an old mini shovel which I packed out. Its technically litter, and I can use the shovel. Win win. I made it back to my truck around 12:20 or so. My GPS stats said it was about a 9 mile journey that took just a few minutes shy of 8 hours. One last view of Hawkins peak and the before descending\nI can see why this isn’t a super popular peak to hike, its not very prominent, and there are a ton of other cooler looking peaks nearby to draw you away. That said, I’m glad this was on the OGUL list as it forced me to go have a really nice tranquil day in the woods. I didn’t see another soul while I was out there, and the scenery was fantastic in more than one way. Definitely give this peak a try if you’re looking for a nice easy ski and some solitude.\nRoute My route GPX Track Download\n",

It brings me joy regardless of the conditions, a day out splitboarding is a good day. That said, I’ve also been (very) slowly chipping away at the Tahoe Ogul Peak List, and Rubicon was one of the closer ones that I hadn’t ticked off yet. In addition, the conditions lined up in a way that the snow would probably still be decent there.\nI wanted to get an earlyish start, so I set my alarm for 4am Saturday morning. I say earlyish, because 2:45am is usually when my “early” alarm for mountain adventures usually goes off. It hurts, but watching the sunrise from a mountain is always worth it. Plus I usually don’t feel too tired once I get a Yerba Mate or a Redbull in me. I was out the door by 4:30 or so, I can’t recall exactly but that seems accurate. Made a quick stop at the Pollock Pines Safeway for some snacks (a terrible grocery store, but it’s on the way and open 24 hours).\nI arrived at the trailhead, which is really just a dead end street. I had never been here before, but understood that parking here was a contentious subject. I’m all for being respectful of neighborhoods, but it’s a dead end street, and you shouldn’t need to be a millionaire to access our public lands. I parked my truck as out of the way as possible, and was off right around 7am.\nMy Truck with a beautiful Tahoe sunrise behind it\nI was a little bit torn on which track to follow right after starting, one took a left up ~50 vertical feet higher onto a ridge than the other, and I ended up opting for that one. There were a lot of return tracks through here, so it seemed like the right place to be. The elevation gain was fairly gradual for a while, and soon it opened up to a beautiful long bench heading straight towards the peak. The trees here were clearly very old, something about being among old growth trees really puts me into a peaceful place. As the forest opened up, so did the magnificent views of Tahoe. It was really shaping up to be a nice morning out on the west shore.\nRubicon peak first coming into view from near the start The “bench” below Rubicon\nThe bench eventually connected to the steeper northeast face of Rubicon, and the trees seemed to get a bit more dense, and the terrain a good bit steeper. I continued along an established skin track up until somewhere around 8200 feet, where I lost it in the wind blown snow and some recent descent tracks. Not to worry though, the plan was pretty simple at this point: go up until you can’t anymore. The view of Tahoe from somewhere near where I lost the skin track\nDefinitely one of the more scenic tours I’ve done in the Tahoe area\nThe forest seemed to open up a bit more as I got closer to the top. This were some really nice old trees, and I was having a great time moving through them. I was keeping a really solid pace the whole way up, probably the best pace I had been on all winter. Things always come together during the spring in the mountains. Speaking of spring, it still wasn’t quite feeling like spring. It had snowed a few inches the day before, and there was probably as much as 4 or 5 inches of windblown powder up near the top in shaded areas. Conditions were better than I had been expecting.\nThe tree spacing opening up\nAwesome Conditions near the top\nI made the final push up to the summit block, and was just about a hundred vertical feet from the top around 8:50AM. About 2100 vertical feet of climbing down, and half of which breaking trail, in less than 2 hours. I was pretty stoked with my work. This pace doesn’t come naturally for me, apparently several years of running on my lunch break are starting to work. The final ridge leading to the peak\nThe summit of Rubicon peak is a big steep rock face that probably ranges between class 3 and 5 depending on where you climb it from. I dropped my skis at the edge of the snow and circled around to the west side of the peak. From here I found a route up the rocks that was barely doable in ski boots. I managed to make it to the top, although I didn’t fully stand on it. I kind of just poked my head over and touched it with my hands. Maybe that counts, maybe it doesn’t. I’m sure I’ll be back at some point anyways so I’m not too worried either way. I made my way back down to my skis and saw a lady and her poodle had made their way up as well. We chatted for a few minutes as I got my splitboard ready. The view to the east from the summit Looking southeast Looking southwest into Desolation\nI dropped in and more or less tried to follow my tracks from the way up as I was still not super familiar with the terrain. The snow was somewhat variable, but mostly really good. There were some really fun big open sections with great soft snow and an even better view of Tahoe. I stopped once or twice to let my legs recover, but it was a pretty quick return trip. I saw a few groups down on the big bench that leads to the steeper section, and we exchanged some waves and mutual stoke as I passed by. The final section down to the car was a bit icy, but wasn’t too bad. I made it back to the truck somewhere around 9:30. The parking area was completely filled up, I was glad I had turned my truck around so the exit was easy.\nI drove back to highway 50, and stopped off at Sierra at Tahoe for a few hours of resort riding. I had just snagged their deal for a pass for the remainder of spring, plus the rest of next year for 400 bucks, not bad. This was my first time at a resort in probably 5 years. Sierra has always been my favorite resort in Tahoe. It’s definitely changed post Caldor fire but the vibe is still the same, and I still knew my way around. All in all, a fantastic day of snowboarding and enjoying the mountains.\nPyramid Peak in the distance from the Nob Hill Chair at Sierra\n",

    "content": "Background There are quite a few ways you can authenticate over SSH, I’ll outline what seem to be the most popular ones:\nProbably the most common is to just use a password, this is neither enjoyable for the user, nor is it the most secure way to do things. If you have password auth enabled on a public facing server, its going to get hammered with attempts from bots all day. You can install Fail2ban, which might stop the most unsophisticated of attacks, but attackers are smart enough to try from multiple IP addresses now. There’s a project called Crowdsec that dubs itself “The spiritual successor to Fail2ban”, which does this a bit more intelligently by using a crowd sourced list of bad IPs. Even with this in place though, don’t use password auth. Just don’t, use the next option at bare minimum.\nThe next best option is to use keypairs. This consists of a private key (only you have this private key, hence the name), and a public key (this key lives in the authorized_keys file on the server you’re trying to connect to). The private key is used to decrypt a message sent by the target server which was encrypted by the public key. The private key is the only thing that can decrypt this message, provided you’re using a strong algorithm (ed25519 is what most people recommend these days). This is a whole lot better than a password, but there are still some issues. This is putting a lot of trust on the machine where the private key lives, which is presumably somebody’s laptop or workstation. I’ve come top learn over the years of working in IT that workstations can be scary places. People use them to browse the web, and often to install sketchy shit they downloaded from the web.\nWhat if there was a way to leverage a trusted server to authenticate the user, rather than just blindly trusting the private key on the users machine? That’s where ssh certificates come in. With certificates, rather than having a target machine trust a public key tied to a user’s private key, we have that target server trust a public key signed by a CA. That certificate authority gets requests from the user to sign a certificate that leverages the keypair that lives on their machine. This is basically ssh keys on steroids. Ultimately the decision of whether or not somebody can access the target server gets moved to the CA, not the user’s machine. This pattern has gained a lot of popularity in the past few years. Its fairly trivial to set up for a proof of concept, you just need a CA, and can sign certificates with some openssl commands. On the target machine, you just need the root CA’s public key, and a simple one line modification to the sshd config file. Managing this at scale is where things tend to get tricky however. A few companies have come up with products that make this easier to manage at scale. I’ve tried a few of them and will give some brief opinions below.\nCommercial Offerings Smallstep - Fairly simple to set up, reliable and consistent. You can set up an external IDP which will do the authentication piece. Basically just log in with Google, or whatever you use, and its that easy for users. They offer a free tier, so if you wanted to use this at home, you should have no issues. That said, its very basic and really doesn’t offer the cleanest end user experience. Configuring target hosts felt a bit clunky compared to other options. This was a really solid option all things said though.\nBastionZero - Very secure and cool technology at play. They use a double root of trust, meaning if your IDP got compromised, the attacker would also need to compromise BastionZero’s systems. The people behind it are brilliant, like some seriously smart people, so I’d say this may be the most secure option available. They don’t offer a free tier as far as I can tell, so not a great homelab option. When we demoed this at work, it still felt a bit immature, there were a good bit of bugs we encountered with the client, and it felt a bit heavy compared to other options (this doesn’t use the regular ssh binary, it uses its own proprietary one). Perhaps the biggest downfall of their architecture was that all of your traffic gets routed through the cloud, this resulted in slow performance compared to a regular ssh session.\nStrongDM - This option uses regular ssh under the hood, as SmallStep does as well. They offer a command line client, as well a a GUI client, both of which are very easy to use and user friendly. They also leverage an external IDP (including SAML and OIDC), SmallStep offers OIDC but not SAML. Configuring target hosts is very simple, just add the root CA key somewhere on the machine, and edit a single line of the ssh config. They do not offer a free tier, and the pricing isn’t the cheapest thing in the world. That said, its a really solid product and by far the best choice for an enterprise in my opinion. Its very much a “set it and forget it” type of product.\nTeleport - I have never used this one, but thought it was worth mentioning. It seems a bit “heavy” based on my research, you can’t just use the regular openssh client, you need to use their proprietary one. It does offer a free tier, so this may be worth checking out. I’ve heard good things about it.\nHashicorp Vault - Vault offers a ssh certificate secrets engine on top of the other variety of things it does. Its probably the most basic of the options listed above, and not something I tested out at work. Vault basically provides the CA, and some fairly simple vault commands to request certificates, leveraging whatever method you use to authenticate to the Vault with. Its not at all fancy, and not very user friendly out of the box. That said, I already run a Vault at home, and its something a lot of companies already have. Vault has an open source offering, and in my opinion Hashicorp really does a good job of differentiating their paid and free product without coming off as greedy. The free open source Vault is great, and if you have a lot of secrets to store, you can really get a lot of value for free with it.\nWith all of this in mind, I chose to use Vault for my home use. I’ll be showing how I set up Vault as my ssh cert CA, as well as a script I wrote to make it a bit more user friendly.\nVault Configuration This all assumes you have a Hashicorp Vault up and running already. There are plenty of guides put there on how to do this (including one on this blog about how to set it up in Kubernetes). It’s also assumed that you have the proper permissions to do all of this on your Vault.\nFirst we need to configure the Vault’s SSH signing secret engine. All of these steps are also available in Hashicorp’s documentation, so if you get stuck, or something seems unclear, make sure to check there.\nvault secrets enable -path=ssh-client-signer ssh Note that the path here is completely up to you, this was what the example in the Vault documentation uses, and I saw no need to change it personally.\nNext we need to create a CA key, you are able to use an existing one as well, but I prefer to just leave the private key in the Vault and never see it.\nvault write ssh-client-signer/config/ca generate_signing_key=true The last thing we need for the Vault is a signing role, modify the command below as needed, and run it to create your role. The most important thing to pay attention to is the default user, this user needs to exist on the target server.\nvault write ssh-client-signer/roles/ssh-user -\u003c\u003c\"EOH\" { \"algorithm_signer\": \"rsa-sha2-256\", \"allow_user_certificates\": true, \"allowed_users\": \"*\", \"allowed_extensions\": \"permit-pty,permit-port-forwarding\", \"default_extensions\": { \"permit-pty\": \"\" }, \"key_type\": \"ca\", \"default_user\": \"yourUser\", \"ttl\": \"30m0s\" } EOH Target Server Configuration Log into one of the machines you want to use as a target, ie one you plan to ssh into with these certificates. Run the command below to write out the public key for the Vault CA we just created into the /etc/ssh directory. Make sure to replace the \u003cyour vault address\u003e section with the actual address of your Vault (don’t forget the port if not listening on port 443 or 80)\ncurl -o /etc/ssh/trusted-user-ca-keys.pem https://\u003cyour vault address\u003e/v1/ssh-client-signer/public_key Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and add the following line to the end of it:\nTrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/trusted-user-ca-keys.pem Finally, restart sshd to load the new config systemctl restart sshd\nScript Here is where the script comes in, the process of creating a key, and requesting a cert from Vault is a bit convoluted, and immediately struck me as something I wouldn’t want to need to do all the time. That’s why I spent a bit of time writing this script. It should handle creating the ssh keypair for you if it doesn’t exist, as well as requesting the cert from Vault. It then will also save the cert to a file, make sure the permissions are correct on the cert, and add the private key to your ssh agent. The goal here was being able to ssh into the target server without much more fuss than just using a regular ssh key. This results in short lived ssh access that’s tied to your Vault authentication rather than a key that sits around on your machine indefinitely.\n#!/bin/bash TYPE=ed25519 KEY=id_\"$TYPE\"_\"$1\" if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then echo \"Key name not provided. Use syntax 'cert \u003cdesired_key_name\u003e' next time!\" exit 1 fi if test -f \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"; then vault write -field signed_key ssh-client-signer/sign/my-role public_key=@\"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\".pub \u003e \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub chmod 600 \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub ssh-add ~/.ssh/\"$KEY\" else echo $HOME/.ssh/$KEY ssh-keygen -t $TYPE -a 100 -f $HOME/.ssh/$KEY vault write -field signed_key ssh-client-signer/sign/my-role public_key=@\"$HOME/.ssh/$KEY.pub\" \u003e \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub chmod 600 \"$HOME\"/.ssh/\"$KEY\"-cert.pub ssh-add ~/.ssh/\"$KEY\" fi So in practice, you can just run this script with a single argument, that argument being the name of your desired key. So if I wanted to use a key named “test”, and had saved the script as cert.sh I would run the script as cert.sh test, which would create a few files for me:\nid_ed25519_test.pub - standard pubkey id_ed25519_test - standard private key id_ed25519_test-cert.pub - signed ssh certificate The script will also add the private key to your ssh agent. With the naming convention it follows, the agent should be able to automatically find the signed cert, and you should be able to ssh into servers without needing to pass any additional arguments. If that doesn’t work for some reason, you can simply pass the cert with the -i flag, ie ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_test-cert.pub me@myserver.com\nFinally, to make this a bit easier, you can put the script somewhere in your path, such as /usr/local/bin/cert. You can then simply call it with cert \u003cname of desired cert\u003e, so my workflow to ssh into a server looks like this:\nCreate the cert cert mycert SSH into the server as you normally would, ssh myserver That’s it, as long as your ssh-agent is running, this should work without any additional steps. You may need to specify a user if the user on the target server differs from your local user, ie ssh mischa@myserver. I hope someone finds this interesting some day, I really enjoy using this setup for all of my home ssh needs.\n",

    "content": "Hashicorp Vault I have spent quite a bit of time over the past 6 months setting up Hashicorp Vault at work. Its been a fun experience, and I have learned a lot. I’m always a fan of running whatever I run at work in my homelab, and Vault has really proven to be a useful tool. Recently, I’ve been playing around with Kubernetes again, and figured Vault would be a great place to store my Kubernetes secrets. In this post, I’ll try to outline how I set up Vault on my cluster, and how I use it with other apps on the cluster.\nPrerequisites I opted to use AWS KMS to unseal the Vault, this requires creating a KMS key on AWS first. You don’t need to do this if you’re fine manually unsealing the vault. To me this is worth the cost of slightly less than a dollar a month. I’m not going to get into the weeds about how to create a KMS key. You basically just need the key, and an IAM role and credentials. There are plenty of good guides out there like this one.\nA cluster you have control over (obviously). I’m running a 5 node k3s cluster, I used this repo as a jumping off point to deploy it with Ansible.\nHelm installed on your machine that can control your cluster.\nHelm Chart Now that we have a cluster and an (optional) KMS key, we can get to deploying the Valut. I opted to use the Helm chart provided by Hashicorp, this is by far the easiest way I have come across to install apps in Kubernetes, and seems to be the industry favorite.\nThe fist step was to install the Helm repo and update Helm’s repos\nhelm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com \u0026\u0026 helm repo update Now we need to create some Kubernetes secrets for our AWS KMS config. This may seem a bit confusing, as we are creating the Vault to store secrets in, but we don’t have that yet, so a Kubernetes secret will work for now.\nFirst we need to base64 encode the secrets. I did this from WSL on my laptop, any Linux machine will do, and there is probably a way to do it on Windows and MacOS. To encode a string, use the following syntax (make sure to use the -n flag for echo, or it will include a newline character and really mess up your day) echo -n \u003cyourStringHere\u003e | base64 Encode each of the values in the yaml snippet shown below, and create a file like it named secret.yaml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: namespace: vault name: vault type: Opaque data: AWS_REGION: \u003cbase64 here\u003e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: \u003cbase64 here\u003e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: \u003cbase64 here\u003e VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID: \u003cbase64 here\u003e With that out of the way, we can create our values.yaml. I chose to do an HA setup with raft storage, but you can use standalone if you don’t want the extra overhead. You can find a good overview of what to use in your values.yaml on Hashicorp’s Website\nglobal: enabled: true server: extraSecretEnvironmentVars: - envName: AWS_REGION secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_REGION - envName: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - envName: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY secretName: vault secretKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - envName: VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID secretName: vault secretKey: VAULT_AWSKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID dev: enabled: false standalone: enabled: false ha: enabled: true config: | ui = true listener \"tcp\" { tls_disable = 1 address = \"[::]:8200\" cluster_address = \"[::]:8201\" } seal \"awskms\" {} service_registration \"kubernetes\" {} storage \"raft\" { path = \"/vault/data\" } raft: enabled: true setNodeId: true config: | ui = true listener \"tcp\" { tls_disable = 1 address = \"[::]:8200\" cluster_address = \"[::]:8201\" } seal \"awskms\" {} service_registration \"kubernetes\" {} storage \"raft\" { path = \"/vault/data\" } Now we can install it with helm upgrade --install vault hashicorp/vault -f values.yaml -n vault\nOnce the containers are created (check with kubectl -n vault get pods), exec into the first node and init the cluster kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-0 -- vault operator init\nJoin the second node kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-1 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200\nAnd the third node kubectl -n vault exec -ti vault-2 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200\nYou should now have a running 3 node Vault cluster in Kubernetes. Nice work! It still needs a TLS cert and ingress created to access the Vault. For my certs, I use CertManager, and for ingress, I use Traefik. I won’t get into the weeds about how those are set up in this post, but I will leave some yaml snippets of them below. Happy Vaulting!\nCertificate --- apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: mischaf-us-prod namespace: vault spec: secretName: mischaf-us-production-tls issuerRef: name: letsencrypt-production kind: ClusterIssuer commonName: \"vault.mischaf.us\" dnsNames: - \"vault.mischaf.us\" Ingressroute apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRoute metadata: name: vault-gui namespace: vault annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik-external spec: entryPoints: - websecure routes: - match: Host(`vault.mischaf.us`) kind: Rule services: - name: vault-active port: 8200 namespace: vault tls: secretName: mischaf-us-production-tls ",

    "content": "1/28/2023 This was my second tour of the year. I got a bit of a late start, but I had a busy start of the season dealing with the insane amount of rain I got at home. Thankfully that translates to a huge amount of snow in the mountains. I had enjoyed some awesome, waist deep powder on Waterhouse the weekend before, but I knew that the soft snow was going to be harder and harder to find. I also had to be in Oakland that night, so I wanted something relatively quick. Therefore I opted for some good old fashioned corn snow on the south face of Ralston.\nRecon shot of the Ralston Ridge I got the previous weekend\nI packed up my truck the night before, and was on the road by 5:30AM or so. Typically I’ve always been able to park at the Camp Sacramento sign and skin up from there. With all of the snow this year, I wasn’t able to park there, so I snagged a pull out a mile or so east of there, in one of the areas that seemed to get hit the hardest by the Caldor fire.\nLooking back at my truck\rLooking up towards the ridge\rI geared up, crossed highway 50 (probably the most dangerous part of the day’s journey), and started my way up. I started up the west side of the drainage directly in front of me, there was a decent amount of tree cover, but they were almost all dead from the fire. Just a few years before, this was a relatively healthy forest, and had a completely different aesthetic. It was definitely sad to see how intense the fire was through this section. I’m not a fire expert, but my understanding is that this was the second wildfire ever recorded to cross the Sierra crest (the other being the Dixie fire the same year). I tried my best to be optimistic, and thought about what the ride down would be like, which lifted my spirits a bit.\nDead Trees on the way up\rI was able to skin up about 500 vertical feet or so before deciding it was time to switch booting, as the snow was pretty firm and the slope was getting steeper. I continued up through the trees towards the ridgeline, changing my mind about which side to go up about half way up, and cutting a line more towards the east. Near the top, I switched back to skinning, and was on the ridge around 9:30 AM. From here it was a pretty mellow tour up to the next ridge that this one was connected to that runs to the proper summit of Mt Ralston.\nLooking northwest towards the Crystal Range\rMy last push up the ridge\rFrom here I had a great view of Sierra at Tahoe, the place where I learned to snowboard. Sierra will always hold a special place in my heart, even if I have all but given up on lift accessed snowboarding. The vibe there was always the most laid back of all of the resorts I ever went to, and I have fond memories of spending long days there with my friends as a teenager. West Bowl looks entirely different, much more of a proper bowl now. I read on their website that they harvested 5 million board feet of salvaged wood from the fire.\nSierra at Tahoe’s West Bowl\nI stopped for a quick snack near the top of a big rock face you can see from highway 50. The snow seemed to be warming up pretty quickly, so I decided I’d tour another 20 minutes to half an hour, and then start my descent. The summit was tempting, but not really steep enough for a smooth snowboard descent. I’ve been up Ralston more times than I can count, but this point on the ridge was new to me. From my high point I snapped a few pictures, and switched my splitboard over to ride mode. I contemplated which way to descend, going more to the west seemed a bit safer, but the snow over there was not very smooth due to all of the wind it gets. I love Ralston, but I’ve noticed over the years that the southwest side gets hammered by wind funneled up through the highway 50 corridor, which can often make for suboptimal riding conditions. I pondered for a minute or 2, and assessed that dropping into the more southeast side probably wasn’t too risky. The snow seemed pretty consolidated as it gets quite a bit of sun on it, and it also wasn’t abnormally warm for a January morning.\nThe view looking northeast from my high point\rWind affected snow on a southwest facing slope\rThe run I ended up taking started just to the right of the cluster of trees near the center-left of the picture\rNot wanting to waste any more time, I dropped in just south of Cup Lake, and enjoyed some fantastic wide open riding. My legs were a little shot due to being a bit low on electrolytes, but I managed to eek a good run out of it. I traversed the bowl below, and got to the top of the burned out trees and took a short break to let my legs bounce back a bit.\nLooking down on what ended up being a spectacular tree run\rThe ride through the trees was by far the best part of the day. The snow was right at the sweet spot of softness. I was able to make big sweeping turns through the now perfectly spaced trees. Forests that get burned this severely end up making some fantastic tree runs. The branches that would normally be slapping you all over your body are gone. What you’re left with is a perfect obstacle course to zig and zag through. The snow got a bit sticky towards the very bottom, but I was able to easily glide all the way back to the highway. I took a quick look back, snapped a few pictures, and disconnected from my bindings directly across the street from my truck. After waiting for what felt like an eternity for the endless line of cars on Highway 50, I crossed the road and was back in my truck before 11:15.\nOutside the Fox Theater\rI was home by 12:30, ate lunch and hung out for a few hours. That evening, me and my wife drove down to Oakland to see J.I.D. and Smino play at the Fox Theater. They put on a great show, and we were back home probably around 1:30AM. A perfect California day (maybe just a bit tiring), I love where I live.\nJ.I.D. Performing at the Fox Theater",

    "content": " ** Note, as of ~mid 2022, I moved over to Tailscale, and eventually Twingate. This was a fun project, but Twingate does the job without the cost of the VPS\nWhere I live there are essentially 2 options for(usable in this day and age) internet, you go with one of the local WISPs, or you use LTE in some form. The latter of the 2 is what I have ended up with after a few years of spotty and slow sevice with 2 different WISPs. It has some limitations, but I’m able to get 40-50Mbps down and 10-15Mbps up consistently. Someday Elon Musk and Starlink will save me, but for now it works. One of said limitations of using a Verizon LTE connection is Verizon’s CGNAT. This is Verizon’s way of continuing to use it’s finite supply of V4 addresses for a large pool of customers. This can be a big pain when trying to port forward services from you LAN to the internet(which probably isn’t the smartest thing to do anyways). That said, I do have some services on the LAN that are really handy to have access to while away from the house. The most important one for me is Home Assistant, but other things like Blue Iris, or even just being able to ssh into a box can come in really handy. While researching this issue, I initially avoided using VPNs as I had used Open VPN in the past, but wasn’t impressed by the performance or ease of setup. I successfully used a few things such as ssh tunnels, NGROK, and another project who’s name escapes me. All of them did the job, but had their quirks. It never really reached the level of reliability to just set and forget. Eventually, I stumbled upon Wireguard, and by stumble, I mean I read so many comments in forums and reddit posts suggesting it that I caved and decided to try it. Initially the setup seemed a bit complicated, but after getting it working I realized that it performed really well. Probably the fastest connection that I was able to get out of any of the solutions that I had tried. I now run a full tunnel on my phone that directs tunnels everything to either my LAN, or through the VPS. This makes sketchy free WiFi a lot safer, and I hardly notice any speed penalty. Now I’m going to go into some of the details of how I got this set up as both a resource for anyone that finds my humble little blog looking for answers, and as documentation for my future self.\nThings needed: A device capable of running Wireguard and doing IP forwarding to other devices on the LAN. A VPS, or a computer somewhere that has a publically routable IP address. Some client to connect from outside the lan, such as a cell phone. ~30 Minutes of your time Setup: The first logical step is to get Wireguard installed on the VPS. In my case I’m using Ubunto 20.04, which has Wireguard support baked into the kernel. If you’re using a different distro, it may be as simple as \u003cpackage manager\u003e install wireguard. If not, consult the Wireguard docs. It’s alwaays a good idea to update your repo sources before installing something. sudo apt update Now you should be good to install the Wireguard package. apt install wireguard Now that we have the package installed, its time to get the server configured. Wireguard stores its config under /etc/wireguard by default. I prefer the vim editor, but nano is another good option if you don’t feel like learning how to use vim. sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf creates a new file under the /etc/wireguard directory, and opens vim to edit the file. In my case, the file looks like this: [Interface] PrivateKey = \u003cyour private key\u003e ListenPort = 51820 Address = 10.0.50.1/24 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE [Peer] PublicKey = \u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs = 10.0.50.2/32 ,10.0.0.0/24, 192.168.0.0/24 Let’s break this down a bit. Everything under [Interface] is describing the interface on the local(to the config file) machine, in this case wg0.\nTo get a private key, you can run wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey \u003e publickey to generate 2 files, publickey and privatekey. The private key should never leave this machine, and it’s content can be pasted into the config file. We will use the public key for the config of the clients later. The listen port is fairly self explanitory, the port that Wireguard is listening on. You can change this for some added security, but that’s arguably more obscurity than security. The address the is the address that the interface (wg0 in this case) will use. Postup is for running a command after the interface comes up. Here we are using some iptables rules to accept incoming and outgoing traffic from the Wireguard interface, and then routing traffic from wg0 to eth0. PostDown is the opposite of PostUp. Here we are deleting the iptables entries after wg0 does down. Everything under [Peer] describes another node on the wireguard network. You can make multiple if you want multiple nodes.\nThe public key can be generated on the peer later, and pasted into here. Now that we have the config mostly set up on the VPS, we can configure the device on the LAN to act as a gateway. Follow steps 1 and 2 again on the LAN device, and generate another keypair on this device. wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey \u003e publickey Edit /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf on this device now, the config should look something like this: [Interface] PrivateKey=\u003cyour private key\u003e Address=10.0.50.2 ListenPort=51820 PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT PostUp = sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT PostDown = sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 [Peer] PublicKey=\u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs=0.0.0.0/0 PersistentKeepalive=25 Endpoint=\u003cvps public IP address\u003e:51820 The public key will be the public key we generated on the VPS AllowedIPs is for which IP address ranges you want to allow to communicate with the interface wg0. You can use a /32 if you only want a single IP, a /24 for a standard network, or really anything including 0.0.0.0/0 if you want to allow all traffic. PersistentKeepAlive keeps the tunnel alive by sending packets as often as you tell it to. 25 seconds seems to be what most people use, and it’s worked well for me Endpoint is the address of the Wireguard server, in this case the VPS. You can use an IP or a dns name here, and make sure to include the port number. Grab the public key from the LAN device, and go paste it into the VPS config under the Peer section. Now we should be able to fire up the interfaces. To do this, run wg-quick up wg0 on both devices. Try sending a ping from one interface to the other, and vice versa. If everything was set up correctly, you should be seeing replies. Ping a device on the LAN from the VPS, that should also work and indicates that the ip forwarding rules worked. If it’s not, check if ip forwarding is enabled on the LAN side with the command sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward. 0 indicates it being disabled, 1 indicates it being enabled. Now you can configure a mobile device. I have an Android phone, and was able to install the Wireguard app from the Play Store. The configuration is pretty straight forward and similar to the other devices. You can even generate a keypair with a button on the mobile app. If you’d like to tunnel all traffic through the VPN, use 0.0.0.0/0 for the allowed IPs. If not, use the subnet for the wireguard itnerface, 10.0.50.0/24, and whichever LAN subnets you want access to. Copy the public key for the [Peer] entry on the VPS which should look like this: [Peer] PublicKey = \u003cyour public key\u003e AllowedIPs = 10.0.50.3/32 9. At this point everything should be working. If you’re having issues, a good place to start is using the tcpdump command, and logically going through the steps of what needs to happen. I had some difficulties the first few times I set this up, but have no issues repeating it now. 10. For bonus points, run PiHole either on the VPS, or somehwere on your LAN, and point to it for DNS on the smartphone config. This will give you always on ad blocking if you use the full tunnel option. I run my phone with the full tunnel on almost 100% of the time, save for the few services that act weird when you use a VPS public IP address(looking at you, Netflix).\n",

We arrived at the trail head at 7:30 that morning and started towards the Forni lake trail with plenty of mosquitoes to keep us company. The first leg of the journey was fairly uneventful, I’ve hiked to Forni lake probably a dozen times or so. We made good time to the big Mule’s Ear field, which was just starting to bloom. Jed in the field of Mule’s Ears\nWe made it to the lake not long after, and opted to climb the ridge south of the lake rather than take the trail that leads to Tell’s Peak.\nLooking west from the top of the ridge\nBy 10:30, we were on top of the ridge with a great view of nearby Crystal Range peaks, as well as a sliver of Tahoe(there was a bit of haze that morning, but we could just make it out).\nLooking south toward McConnell peak\nWe hung out for a few minutes, and discussed what looked like the best option to get down to Highland Lake. We decided to go down a drainage just to the right of where we crested the ridge. It was a big slow going at first getting down some large drop offs, but overall not too bad. We made it down to Highland Lake right around lunch time. My dad descending towards Highland Lake\nAt Highland Lake, we were happy to count at least 50 yellow legged frogs in a small area where we ate lunch – a species that was classified as endangered just a few years ago. It seems that the remoteness of this lake has worked to the frog’s advantage. Yellow Legged Frogs\nWe hung out for probably 30-45 minutes, eating lunch and taking a few quick dips into the frigid alpine water. At one point we heard what sounded like thunder, and saw a large sheet of snow get dislodged from the steep granite slabs southwest of the lake. Before long we packed up and started making our way to the next lake.\nMy CalTopo map showed a trail from Highland Lake to Lake Zitella, so we decided to try to find that. After a few hundred yards of walking along what was supposed to be a trail, we realized that the trail was probably long forgotten, and more of a route. We passed a few small lakes that flowed out of Highland, and crossed the drainage a quarter mile or so east of the lake. From there we continued southeast towards a saddle between 2 points that led us to Lake Zitella.\nWe ended up choosing probably the worst possible route up the saddle, going up a very steep creek covered with slippery moss and grass, at one point skirting a small waterfall. the small waterfall\nBefore long though, we were at the top of the saddle looking down at Lake Zitella. Jed looking down towards Zitella Lake\nWe saw some impressive and steep granite slabs to the west of the lake, Desolation continues to impress me with its immense amounts of granite.\nSteep granite slabs above Zitella Lake\nAt Zitella, we stopped again for more snacks and swimming. The water was surprisingly warm compared to Highland lake. At this point we decided it would be good to turn back, since we didn’t have an overnight permit and needed to camp outside the desolation boundary. We found a better route to the east of the saddle, and made our way back down to the Highland Lake drainage. My dad climbing back towards Highland Lake\nWe made much better time getting back down to the Highland drainage, and started the long slog back up. Looking up towards the ridge south of Tells peak was daunting. We had a long steep climb ahead of us. Surprisingly though, the climb wasn’t nearly as bad as any of us expected, and we were back up around 5pm. Looking east towards Highland Lake\nLooking north towards Tell’s Peak\nWe opted to take the Tell’s Peak trail back down to Forni, which was hard to follow but had enough cairns to make it manageable. By 6 we were back at Forni. We made great time from here on, quickly walking down the well beaten trail that we were thankful to be on. Right around the Desolation boundary, the mosquitoes started to get bad. This motivated us to walk faster, and as we descended they got even worse. We ended up continuing to power walk all the way to the cars and were done with our ~17 mile out and back by 7:45. With the amount of mosquitoes out, and being at the cars we elected to call it a day trip. My Dad and I quickly said goodbye to Jed as we fought off hoards of mosquitoes, hopped in the car and headed off.\nThe goal was to see how we fared doing 15 miles with full packs, expecting a small section of cross country travel between the Crystal Range ridge and Highland Lake. However past the ridge it was more or less all cross country. We exceeded our mileage, and in conditions far worse than what could be found anywhere on the PCT. Mission accomplished.\n",
