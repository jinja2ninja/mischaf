      <description>Background There are quite a few ways you can authenticate over SSH, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline what seem to be the most popular ones:
Probably the most common is to just use a password, this is neither enjoyable for the user, nor is it the most secure way to do things. If you have password auth enabled on a public facing server, its going to get hammered with attempts from bots all day.</description>

      <description>Hashicorp Vault I have spent quite a bit of time over the past 6 months setting up Hashicorp Vault at work. Its been a fun experience, and I have learned a lot. I&amp;rsquo;m always a fan of running whatever I run at work in my homelab, and Vault has really proven to be a useful tool. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Kubernetes again, and figured Vault would be a great place to store my Kubernetes secrets.</description>
