      <description>I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, but primarily spend my time outside running, hiking, peakbagging, or splitboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been known to enjoy cycling, both road and mountain, but have been enjoying being on my feet more lately. I&amp;rsquo;m currently focused on finishing the Tahoe Ogul Peak List, a list of 63 peaks within a few hours of Tahoe. I have been doing these since before I knew the list existed in 2014.</description>

      <description>I love technology, its really the primary driver behind this website (I enjoy the infrastructure more than writing posts). You can find some stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve felt the need to document here, some day I hope to add more content to this section.
