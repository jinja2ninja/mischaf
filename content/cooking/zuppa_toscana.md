## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb Italian Sausage. Ground preferred, if not, remove the casing. Use spicy sausage if desired.
- [ ] 4 tablespoons butter
- [ ] ½ diced yellow onion
- [ ] 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- [ ] 6 cups chicken broth
- [ ] 2 cups water
- [ ] ~2lbs Potatoes, I like Yukon Gold but Russet works fine as well. Diced into 1/2" pieces or larger if desired
- [ ] Salt to taste
- [ ] Pepper to taste
- [ ] 2 cups heavy cream
- [ ] 4 cups chopped kale
- [ ] Garnish with Parmesan, chives, bacon bits, hot sauce, you name it.

## Steps
- [ ] In a large stock pot, cook the sausage until browned. Remove it from the pot, but let some of the grease stay behind.
- [ ] Saute the onions until they start to turn translucent, add the garlic for another minute or 2. You can add the potatoes for a few minutes at this point as well to speed up the cooking.
- [ ] Add everything else but the kale and heavy cream, save those for later. Stir until combined and bring to a boil, then cook on medium low until the potatoes are tender.
- [ ] Add in the kale and heavy cream, and cook for a few more minutes to thicken the soup up.
