I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, but primarily spend my time outside running, hiking, peakbagging, or splitboarding. I've also been known to enjoy cycling, both road and mountain, but have been enjoying being on my feet more lately. I'm currently focused on finishing the [Tahoe Ogul Peak List](https://www.tahoeOgul.org/), a list of 63 peaks within a few hours of Tahoe. I have been doing these since before I knew the list existed in 2014. This May, I decided I want to complete it before I turn 30. This should keep me pretty busy on weekends for the next 6-12 months. I plan to document the remaining peaks I have as of May 2023, which is 40.
