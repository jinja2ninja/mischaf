I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, but primarily spend my time outside running, hiking, peakbagging, splitboarding, and skiing. I've also been known to enjoy cycling, both road and mountain, but have been enjoying being on my feet more lately. My primary focus has become climbing as many peaks as possible, big or small. The majority of my trip reports are under the [Tahoe Ogul Peaks Section](http://localhost:1313/outdoor-trip-reports/ogul-peaks/index.html), but I've also started adding some other miscellaneous peaks, and will likely start to work on other peak lists in the future.
