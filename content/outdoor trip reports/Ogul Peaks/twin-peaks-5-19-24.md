I arrived at the Blackwood Canyon Sno Park around 6:40AM. The sno park had already started its transformation into a campsite parking lot for the summer, made evident by the "Campground Parking Only" signs posted at about half of the parking spots. I made sure to find one without that sign, saddled up my skis on my pack, and began walking up Blackwood Canyon Road. 

Around 3/4 of a mile down the road, I cut through the forest to a section of the ridge that I had identified as not too steep on my map. The wall of the canyon was soon in front of me, and I instantly found myself questioning why I do this for a hobby. Despite my internal struggle, I continued up, trying my best to find a decent route that stuck to rocky terrain. A small amount of bushwhacking ensued, but I was triumphant and topped out on the ridge around 8AM. I stopped briefly to get some sunscreen on, as well as eat a small snack, and set my course to the west, towards Twin Peaks.

**Shortly after leaving the paved road**

The ridge was snow free for the most part where I gained it, at around 7300', but that quickly changed. I picked up a mountain bike trail, which I was able to follow briefly before the snow became deep and mostly continuous around 7500'. From that point, I was just relying on a visual cues and a general sense of direction through the snow. This isn't very hard on a ridge, as it only goes in 2 directions. I came across a road not too far beyond there, and was able to use that a bit as a nice clear path through the trees, but found it meandered a bit too much for my taste, and cut a lot of the corners out. Just east of Stanford Rock, there was a fairly steep slope that the road went around, but again, I just cut straight through. The snow around this elevation started getting quite deep, and there were essentially no dry patches at this point.

**The snow coverage did get much better atop the ridge**

I passed by Stanford Rock, deciding to save that for my return trip, despite being pretty close to it. The ridge then did a bit of a frustrating drop down about a hundred feet, then back up to around 8400 feet. Following that, it dropped yet again around another 300 feet, before flattening out a bit below Twin Peaks. I passed a TRT blaze at one point, and realized that I must have been in this exact place a few summers ago when I did this section of the TRT. The slopes again got a bit steeper, and the snow a bit deeper. It still felt like spring out here, despite it feeling more like summer at the trailhead.

**Twin Peaks showing itself**

Pretty soon I crested the ridge, and the final rock pyramid of the Eastern Twin Peak came into view, with a healthy cornice above a precipitous drop leading up to it. I gave the cornice a wide berth as I walked up the last bit of snow, where I dropped my pack and poles. From there, it was a steep, but easy class II scramble up the rocks to the summit. Despite just being a big pile of what appeared to be loose rocks, the rocks were held together very well. I found hardly any loose rocks as I climbed up. I made it up pretty quickly, and found a fantastic view at the top. I could see quite a few Ogul peaks I've climbed, a great angle of the Crystal Range, Hell Hole Reservoir, and of course a good view of Tahoe.

I hung out for a few minutes, took some pictures, and did all the other things I normally do at the top of a mountain before heading back down to my stuff. Once back at my backpack, I pulled out my foam sitting pad and enjoyed some cold leftover pizza. The purple potato pizza from Slice House in Folsom is a great, albeit unconventional pizza. I didn't linger too long, as the snow was already softer than I had wanted it to be. There didn't seem to be a good refreeze, which typically is the time of year I give up on skiing and snowboarding near Tahoe. I switched into my ski boots, clicked in, and started to ski down.

**Looking back at Twin Peaks after skiing a bit**

The skiing wasn't fantastic, but not terrible either. There were some fun, fairly open sections below Twin Peaks, although that very quickly ended, and I was back at the flat section. I skate skied as far as I could before putting skins on to get back up towards Stanford Rock. The skin up wasn't too bad, I stuck more to the proper ridge this time and made pretty good time. I dropped my skis where the snow ended, perhaps 50 feet south of Stanford Rock. I found a very nice pair of benches there, as well as a summit register. I took a few minutes to sit down on the bench (when in Rome...), and signed the register.

I walked back over to my skis, clicked back in, and continued down. I found a few hundred vertical feet of pretty decent skiing here, weaving through some well spaced, older trees. Around 7700', the skiing turned a bit scrappy as I did my best to connect patches, sometimes skiing on one ski to get through a section of thin snow. Around 7400', I decided it was time to call it, and switched back into my shoes and saddled the skis back up. I opted to take the summer trail back down to the sno park for the return trip. This ended up working out quite well. I was able to keep track of the trail fairly easily, although I did lose it a few times in large snow drifts. The trail popped me out into a residential street, which I took down to briefly join the bike path along highway 89. I made it back to the sno park/campground around 2:30, making my round trip just a bit shy of 8 hours.
