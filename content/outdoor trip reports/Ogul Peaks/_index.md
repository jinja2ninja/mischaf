The Tahoe Ogul list is a list created by a now disbanded chapter of the Sierra Club, the Peak and Gorge Section. "Ogul" is the Washoe word for bighorn sheep. 

I started climbing this list (inadvertently) in 2015. I continued to slowly chip away until spring of 2023, when I set the goal of finishing the remaining 40 I had left before the end of July 2024. I managed to meet my goal, and had a great time doing so. The list got me out to amazing places I'd never have visited.

More information about the list can be found [here](https://www.tahoeogul.org/)
