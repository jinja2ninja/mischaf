This website is a place for me to blog(occasionally) about things that interest me, and hopefully share them with people who are interested in them. Hopefully as time goes on, I'll manage to fill some of the sections in the sidebar up a bit more. If I'm being perfectly honest, I enjoy the blog infrastructure more than I enjoy writing posts.

I'd like to use this as a space to document technical things for myself, and anyone who cares to read them. I believe that by forcing yourself to make your documentation public, you do a better job.

I'm also a big fan of the outdoors, specifically hiking, peak bagging, and [splitboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitboard), so you'll likely see a lot of content about that as well. Hope you enjoy!
